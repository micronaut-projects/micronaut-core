 * The internal pipeline of our HTTP server is by necessity complex and unstable across versions.
 * While we strive to retain compatibility, please do not make too many assumptions about the
 * Micronaut HTTP server pipeline structure when implementing this interface.
 * <br>
 * Implementations of this interface are scoped to different lifetimes. The root customizers can be
 * added through the {@link Registry}, and live while the server is running. Customizers with
 * narrower scope are created from the root customizers through
 * {@link #specializeForChannel specialization} when new netty channels are created by the
 * server, e.g. when a client connects. These specialized customizers will then receive
 * notifications when a certain step in the pipeline setup is reached, so they can do their own
 * customizations on the channel and the channel pipeline they received in the specialization step.
