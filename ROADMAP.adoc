# Micronaut Requirements

## Minimum Feature Set

The following features are a TODO list of things to do on Micronaut before launching

### Core Features

#### Documentation Generation

- We should generate asciidoc documentation for @ConfigurationProperties
- Add generic annotated type visitor API to allow generating OpenAPI doc

#### Aspect Implementations

We need to implement AOP annotations for:

- Spring @Transactional

### Configuration Sharing

Need a mechanism for configuration discovery and sharing across the federation. Configuration sharing should initially support:

* AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html and Example https://gist.github.com/ariesmcrae/b72aa0f986f87977ffc2de42481c8885)

### Auto Configurations and Health Checks

We still need auto-configurations for the following:

* Apache Kafka (ivan)
* Cassandra (nero)
* RabbitMQ (ben)

### Security / JWT Token Solution

Need to implement support for JWT token based authorization

### Management Features

Tasks to complete:

- Endpoints shouldn't be exposed to the web by default
- Integrate Endpoints with Security solution above such that @Endpoint.defaultSensitive is honoured
- Add support for JMX

#### Endpoints

We need endpoints for managing and/or exposing information about:

- logging

These should be built on the `Endpoint` API.

### HTTP Server

#### Content Negotiation

Content negotiation must be supported

#### WebSocket Support

WebSocket Support must be implemented

### HTTP Client

* Connection Pooling
* Server Sent Events
* CONTINUE request handling

#### Distributed Tracing

Built in distributed tracing should be activated by default and allow integration with third-party tools (zipkin, opentracing etc.).

#### Metrics

Built in metrics support on-top of Micro Meter (jack)

#### File Upload Features

* Add support for @Size on blocking types that receive multipart data. Should override the global setting
* Support multiple form data parts with the same name


## POST 1.0 Items

The following items are postponed until after 1.0

### HTTP/2 Support

* The HTTP server should support HTTP/2

### Configuration Sharing

* Google Cloud Runtime Configurator (https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/runtime-configurator/reference/rest/)


### Service Discovery

* Amazon Route 53 (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/overview-service-discovery.html)
* Google Cloud Metadata Server (see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata?hl=en)

### HTTP Gateway

An HTTP gateway that loads on port 8080 and uses the aforementioned HTTP client. The gateway need to be responsible for:

- JWT Token based authentication
- Load Balancing
- Starting Distributed Tracing
- Retry
- Rate limiting
- Route matching on HTTP Request (Path, Method, Header, Host, etc…​)
- Filters to modify downstream HTTP Request and HTTP Response (Add/Remove Headers, Add/Remove Parameters, Rewrite Path etc…​)
