/**
 * Manufactures the compatibility test suite. This TCK relies on
 * [JUnit](http://junit.org/). To integrate the TCK with your
 * injector, create a JUnit test suite class that passes an injected
 * [Car] instance to [testsFor(Car)][.testsFor]:
 *
 *
 *
 * The static `suite` method that returns a `Test` is a JUnit
 * convention. Feel free to run the returned tests in other ways.
 *
 *
 * Configure the injector as follows:
 *
 *
 *  * [org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Car] is implemented by
 * [Convertible][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Convertible].
 *  * [@Drivers][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Drivers]
 * [Seat][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Seat] is
 * implemented by [DriversSeat][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.DriversSeat].
 *  * [Seat][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Seat] is
 * implemented by [Seat][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Seat] itself, and
 * [Tire][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Tire] by
 * [Tire][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Tire] itself
 * (not subclasses).
 *  * [Engine][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Engine] is implemented by
 * [V8Engine][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.V8Engine].
 *  * [@Named(&quot;spare&quot;)][javax.inject.Named]
 * [Tire][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Tire] is implemented by
 * [SpareTire][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.accessories.SpareTire].
 *  * The following classes may also be injected directly:
 * [Cupholder][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.accessories.Cupholder],
 * [SpareTire][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.accessories.SpareTire], and
 * [FuelTank][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.FuelTank].
 *
 *
 *
 * Static and private member injection support is optional, but if your
 * injector supports those features, it must pass the respective tests. If
 * static member injection is supported, the static members of the following
 * types shall also be injected once:
 * [Convertible][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Convertible],
 * [Tire][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.Tire], and
 * [SpareTire][org.atinject.javaxtck.auto.accessories.SpareTire].
 *
 *
 * Use your favorite JUnit tool to run the tests. For example, you can use
 * your IDE or JUnit's command line runner:
 *
 * <pre>
 * java -cp javax.inject-tck.jar:junit.jar:myinjector.jar \
 * junit.textui.TestRunner MyTck</pre>
