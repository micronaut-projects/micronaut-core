/**
 * Manufactures the compatibility test suite. This TCK relies on
 * <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a>. To integrate the TCK with your
 * injector, create a JUnit test suite class that passes an injected
 * {@link Car Car} instance to {@link #testsFor testsFor(Car)}:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import junit.framework.Test;
 * import org.atinject.tck.auto.Tck;
 * import org.atinject.tck.auto.Car;
 *
 * public class MyTck {
 *   public static Test suite() {
 *     Car car = new MyInjector().getInstance(Car.class);
 *     return Tck.testsFor(car,
 *         true /* supportsStatic &#42;/,
 *         true /* supportsPrivate &#42;/);
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The static {@code suite} method that returns a {@code Test} is a JUnit
 * convention. Feel free to run the returned tests in other ways.
 *
 * <p>Configure the injector as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Car} is implemented by
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Convertible Convertible}.
 *   <li>{@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Drivers @Drivers}
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Seat Seat} is
 *       implemented by {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.DriversSeat DriversSeat}.
 *   <li>{@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Seat Seat} is
 *       implemented by {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Seat Seat} itself, and
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Tire Tire} by
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Tire Tire} itself
 *       (not subclasses).
 *   <li>{@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Engine Engine} is implemented by
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.V8Engine V8Engine}.
 *   <li>{@link javax.inject.Named @Named("spare")}
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Tire Tire} is implemented by
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.accessories.SpareTire SpareTire}.
 *   <li>The following classes may also be injected directly:
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.accessories.Cupholder Cupholder},
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.accessories.SpareTire SpareTire}, and
 *       {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.FuelTank FuelTank}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Static and private member injection support is optional, but if your
 * injector supports those features, it must pass the respective tests. If
 * static member injection is supported, the static members of the following
 * types shall also be injected once:
 * {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Convertible Convertible},
 * {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.Tire Tire}, and
 * {@link org.atinject.tck.auto.accessories.SpareTire SpareTire}.
 *
 * <p>Use your favorite JUnit tool to run the tests. For example, you can use
 * your IDE or JUnit's command line runner:
 *
 * <pre>
 * java -cp javax.inject-tck.jar:junit.jar:myinjector.jar \
 *     junit.textui.TestRunner MyTck</pre>
