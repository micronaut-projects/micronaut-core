It also ensures that less memory is occupied as only a reference to the annotation metadata is retained and the full bean can be loaded via the {@link #load()} method.</p>
 *
 * <p>In general results of the {@link #load()} do not need to be cached as object creation is cheap and no runtime analysis is performed so it is extremely fast.</p>
