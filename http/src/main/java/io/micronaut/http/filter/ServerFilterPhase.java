 * Represents phases of server filters. Each phase has a range of 1000 under its control.
 * There are gaps between phases to account for additions of future phases. Filters
 * relying on phases must ensure the order is within the selected phases range. For example
 * {@code ServerFilterPhase.TRACING.before() - 500} is considered an invalid usage of the TRACING
 * phase because that would place the order at 18251, which is outside of the range of the
 * phase (18501-19500).
