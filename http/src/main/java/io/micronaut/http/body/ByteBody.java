/**
 * This class represents a stream of bytes from an HTTP connection. These bytes may be streamed or
 * fully in memory, depending on implementation.
 * <p>Each {@link ByteBody} may only be used once for a "primary" operation (such as
 * {@link #toInputStream()}). However, <i>before</i> that primary operation, it may be
 * {@link #split() split} multiple times. Splitting returns a new {@link ByteBody} that is
 * independent. That means if you want to do two primary operations on the same
 * {@link ByteBody}, you can instead split it once and then do one of the primary operations
 * on the body returned by {@link #split()}.
 * <p>To ensure resource cleanup, {@link #split()} returns a {@link CloseableByteBody}. This
 * body must be closed if no terminal operation is performed, otherwise there may be a memory leak
 * or stalled connection!
 * <p>An individual {@link ByteBody} is <i>not</i> thread-safe: You may not call
 * {@link #split()} concurrently from multiple threads for example. However, the new
 * {@link ByteBody} returned from {@link #split()} is independent, so you may use it on a
 * different thread as this one.
