/**
 * Stereotype annotation that helps to link together instance of the filter and http client that filter should be applied to.
 *
 * In order to use you will need to create new annotation and apply {@link FilterMatcher} on it. After that apply newly
 * created annotation on both instance of the http filter and instance of a http client.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Example:
 *
 * @FilterMatcher
 * public @interface Metered {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * @Metered
 * public class MeteredHttpFilter implements HttpClientFilter {
 *     ....
 * }
 *
 * @Metered
 * private HttpClient httpClient;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * In the example above only clients annotated with {@code @Metered} annotations are going to be filtered by MeteredHttpFilter
