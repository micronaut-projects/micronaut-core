/**
 * An annotation indicating that a bean can be loaded into the Bootstrap Context. The Bootstrap Context is a
 * small {@link io.micronaut.context.ApplicationContext} instance that is loaded in order to support reading
 * distributed configuration.
 *
 * <p>Most beans are not required in this context and only a subset may be needed in order to perform the task of
 * reading distributed configuration. Hence any bean that wishes to be loaded into the context must express that they can be loaded using this annotation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Most developers generally don't have to interact with this annotation and it is generally only used when building a new distributed configuration implementation.</p>
