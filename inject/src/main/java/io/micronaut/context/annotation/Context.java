/**
 * <p>Context scope indicates that the classes life cycle is bound to that of the
 * {@link io.micronaut.context.BeanContext} and it should be initialized and shutdown during startup and shutdown of
 * the underlying {@link io.micronaut.context.BeanContext}.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>Micronaut by default treats all {@link Singleton} bean definitions as lazy and will only load them on demand.  By
 * annotating a bean with @Context you can ensure that the bean is loaded at the same time as the context.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>WARNING: This annotation should be used sparingly as Micronaut is designed in such a way as to encourage minimal
 * bean creation during startup.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>NOTE: This annotation can also be used as a meta annotation</p>
