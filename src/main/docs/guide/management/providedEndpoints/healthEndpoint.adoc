The health endpoint returns information about the "health" of the application, which is determined by any number of "health indicators".

To execute the health endpoint, send a GET request to /health. Additionally the health endpoint exposes /health/liveness and /health/readiness health indicators.

== Configuration

To configure the health endpoint, supply configuration through `endpoints.health`.

.Health Endpoint Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  health:
    enabled: Boolean
    sensitive: Boolean
    details-visible: String <1>
    status:
      http-mapping: Map<String, HttpStatus>
----

<1> One of api:management.endpoint.health.DetailsVisibility[]

The `details-visible` setting controls whether health detail will be exposed to users who are not authenticated.

For example, setting:

.Using `details-visible`
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  health:
    details-visible: ANONYMOUS
----

exposes detailed information from the various health indicators about the health status of the application to anonymous unauthenticated users.

The `endpoints.health.status.http-mapping` setting controls which status codes to return for each health status. The defaults are described in the table below:

|===
|Status | HTTP Code

|api:health.HealthStatus#UP[]
|api:http.HttpStatus#OK[] (200)

|api:health.HealthStatus#UNKNOWN[]
|api:http.HttpStatus#OK[] (200)

|api:health.HealthStatus#DOWN[]
|api:http.HttpStatus#SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE[] (503)

|===

You can provide custom mappings in `application.yml`:

.Custom Health Status Codes
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  health:
    status:
      http-mapping:
        DOWN: 200
----

The above returns api:http.HttpStatus#OK[] (200) even when the api:health.HealthStatus[] is api:health.HealthStatus#DOWN[].

== Customization

The health endpoint consists of a health aggregator and any number of health indicators. To add a health indicator, create a bean class that implements link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/indicator/HealthIndicator.html[HealthIndicator]. It is recommended to also use either link:{api}/io/micronaut/health/indicator/annotation/Liveness.html[@Liveness] or link:{api}/io/micronaut/health/indicator/annotation/Readiness.html[@Readiness] qualifier. If no qualifier is used, the health indicator will be part of /health and /health/readiness endpoints. A base class link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/indicator/AbstractHealthIndicator.html[AbstractHealthIndicator] is available to subclass to make the process easier.

All health indicator beans are collected together with the health aggregator. To provide your own implementation of the health aggregator, create a class that implements link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/aggregator/HealthAggregator.html[HealthAggregator] and register it as a bean. To ensure your implementation is used instead of the default, add the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Replaces.html[@Replaces] annotation to your class with the value being the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/aggregator/RxJavaHealthAggregator.html[default implementation].

The default health aggregator returns an overall status calculated based on the health statuses of the indicators. A link:{api}/io/micronaut/health/HealthStatus.html[health status] consists of several pieces of information.

|=======
|Name |The name of the status
|Description |The description of the status
|Operational |Whether the functionality the indicator represents is functional
|Severity |How severe the status is. A higher number is more severe
|=======

The "worst" status is returned as the overall status. A non-operational status is selected over an operational status. A higher severity is selected over a lower severity.

== Provided Indicators

All Micronaut provided health indicators are exposed on /health and /health/readiness endpoints.

=== Disk Space

A health indicator is provided that determines the health of the application based on the amount of free disk space. Configuration for the disk space health indicator can be provided under the `endpoints.health.disk-space` key.

.Disk Space Indicator Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  health:
    disk-space:
      enabled: Boolean
      path: String #The file path used to determine the disk space
      threshold: String | Long #The minimum amount of free space
----

The threshold can be provided as a string like "10MB" or "200KB", or the number of bytes.

=== JDBC

The JDBC health indicator determines the health of your application based on the ability to successfully create connections to datasources in the application context. The only configuration option supported is to enable or disable the indicator by the `endpoints.health.jdbc.enabled` key.

=== Discovery Client

If your application uses service discovery, a health indicator is included to monitor the health of the discovery client. The data returned can include a list of the services available.
