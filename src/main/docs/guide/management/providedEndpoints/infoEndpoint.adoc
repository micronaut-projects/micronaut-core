The info endpoint returns static information from the state of the application. The info exposed can be provided by any number of "info sources".

To execute the info endpoint, send a GET request to /info.

=== Configuration

To configure the info endpoint, supply configuration through `endpoints.info`.

.Info Endpoint Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
    info:
        enabled: Boolean
        sensitive: Boolean
        id: String
----

The `enabled` property is `true` by default; setting this property to `false` will disable the endpoint.

The `sensitive` property is `false` by default; setting this property to `true` will cause the endpoint to return a 401 if the request is unauthenticated.

NOTE: The `sensitive` property requires the `io.micronaut:security` dependency and the `micronaut.security.enabled` property to be set to `true`.


=== Customization

The info endpoint consists of an info aggregator and any number of info sources. To add an info source, simply create a bean class that implements link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/InfoSource.html[InfoSource].  If your info source needs to retrieve data from Java properties files, you can extend the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/PropertiesInfoSource.html[PropertiesInfoSource] interface which provides a helper method for this purpose.

All of the info source beans will be collected together with the info aggregator. To provide your own implementation of the info aggregator, create a class that implements link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/InfoAggregator.html[InfoAggregator] and register it as a bean. To ensure your implementation is used instead of the default, add the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Replaces.html[@Replaces] annotation to your class with the value being the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/impl/RxInfoAggregator.html[default implementation].

The default info aggregator returns map containing the combined properties returned by all the info sources. This map is returned as JSON from the /info endpoint.

=== Provided Info Sources

==== Configuration Info Source

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/ConfigurationInfoSource.html[ConfigurationInfoSource] will return configuration properties under the `info` key. In addition to string, integer and boolean values, more complex properties can be exposed as maps in the JSON output (if the configuration format supports it).

.Info Source Example (`application.groovy`)
[source,groovy]
----
info.demo.string = "demo string"
info.demo.number = 123
info.demo.map = [ key: 'value', other_key: 123]
----

The above config will result in the following JSON response from the info endpoint:

----
{
  "demo": {
    "string": "demo string",
    "number": 123,
    "map": {
      "key": "value",
      "other_key": 123
    }
  }
}
----

===== Configuration

The configuration info source can be disabled using the `endpoints.info.git.enabled` property.

==== Git Info Source

If a `git.properties` file is available on the classpath, the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/GitInfoSource.html[GitInfoSource] will expose the values in that file under the `git` key. Generating of a `git.properties` file will need to be configured as part of your build; for example, you may choose to use the Gradle Git Properties plugin.

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '2.0.1'
}
----

===== Configuration

To specify an alternate path/name of the properties file, you can supply a custom value in the `endpoints.info.git.location` property.

The git info source can be disabled using the `endpoints.info.git.enabled` property.

==== Build Info Source

If a `META-INF/build-info.properties` file is available on the classpath, the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/BuildInfoSource.html[BuildInfoSource] will expose the values in that file under the `build` key. Generating of a `build-info.properties` file will need to be configured as part of your build.

===== Configuration

To specify an alternate path/name of the properties file, you can supply a custom value in the `endpoints.info.build.location` property.

The git info source can be disabled using the `endpoints.info.build.enabled` property.
