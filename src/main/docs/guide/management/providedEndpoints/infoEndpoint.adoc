The info endpoint returns static information from the state of the application. The info exposed can be provided by any number of "info sources".

To execute the info endpoint, send a GET request to /info.

== Configuration

To configure the info endpoint, supply configuration through `endpoints.info`.

.Info Endpoint Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  info:
    enabled: Boolean
    sensitive: Boolean
----

== Customization

The info endpoint consists of an info aggregator and any number of info sources. To add an info source, simply create a bean class that implements link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/InfoSource.html[InfoSource].  If your info source needs to retrieve data from Java properties files, you can extend the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/PropertiesInfoSource.html[PropertiesInfoSource] interface which provides a helper method for this purpose.

All of the info source beans will be collected together with the info aggregator. To provide your own implementation of the info aggregator, create a class that implements link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/InfoAggregator.html[InfoAggregator] and register it as a bean. To ensure your implementation is used instead of the default, add the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Replaces.html[@Replaces] annotation to your class with the value being the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/impl/RxInfoAggregator.html[default implementation].

The default info aggregator returns map containing the combined properties returned by all the info sources. This map is returned as JSON from the /info endpoint.

== Provided Info Sources

=== Configuration Info Source

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/ConfigurationInfoSource.html[ConfigurationInfoSource] will return configuration properties under the `info` key. In addition to string, integer and boolean values, more complex properties can be exposed as maps in the JSON output (if the configuration format supports it).

.Info Source Example (`application.groovy`)
[source,groovy]
----
info.demo.string = "demo string"
info.demo.number = 123
info.demo.map = [key: 'value', other_key: 123]
----

The above config will result in the following JSON response from the info endpoint:

[source,json]
----
{
  "demo": {
    "string": "demo string",
    "number": 123,
    "map": {
      "key": "value",
      "other_key": 123
    }
  }
}
----

==== Configuration

The configuration info source can be disabled using the `endpoints.info.config.enabled` property.

=== Git Info Source

If a `git.properties` file is available on the classpath, the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/GitInfoSource.html[GitInfoSource] will expose the values in that file under the `git` key. Generating of a `git.properties` file will need to be configured as part of your build. One easy option for Gradle users is the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gorylenko.gradle-git-properties[Gradle Git Properties Plugin]. Maven users can look at the https://github.com/git-commit-id/maven-git-commit-id-plugin[Maven Git Commit Id Plugin].

==== Configuration

To specify an alternate path/name of the properties file, you can supply a custom value in the `endpoints.info.git.location` property.

The git info source can be disabled using the `endpoints.info.git.enabled` property.

=== Build Info Source

If a `META-INF/build-info.properties` file is available on the classpath, the link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/info/source/BuildInfoSource.html[BuildInfoSource] will expose the values in that file under the `build` key. Generating of a `build-info.properties` file will need to be configured as part of your build. One easy option for Gradle users is the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.pasam.gradle.buildinfo[Gradle Build Info Plugin]. Another option for Maven users is the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/examples/build-info.html[Spring Boot Maven Plugin]

==== Configuration

To specify an alternate path/name of the properties file, you can supply a custom value in the `endpoints.info.build.location` property.

The build info source can be disabled using the `endpoints.info.build.enabled` property.
