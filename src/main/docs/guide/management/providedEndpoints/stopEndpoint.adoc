The stop endpoint shuts down the application server.

To execute the stop endpoint, send a POST request to /stop.

=== Configuration

To configure the stop endpoint, supply configuration through `endpoints.stop`.

.Stop Endpoint Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
    stop:
        enabled: Boolean
        sensitive: Boolean
        id: String
----
The `enabled` property is `false` by default and needs to be explicitly enabled to use the endpoint.

The `sensitive` property is `false` by default; setting this property to `true` will cause the endpoint to return a 401 if the request is unauthenticated.

NOTE: The `sensitive` property requires the `io.micronaut:security` dependency and the `micronaut.security.enabled` property to be set to `true`.
