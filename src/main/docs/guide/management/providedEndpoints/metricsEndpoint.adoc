Micronaut includes the ability to expose Metrics via integration with http://micrometer.io[Micrometer].

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply one of the micrometer features to enable metrics and preconfigure the selected registery in your project. For example:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features micrometer-atlas
----
====

The metrics endpoint returns information about the "metrics" of the application. To execute the metrics endpoint, send a GET request to `/metrics`. This will return a list of available metric names.

You can get specific metrics by using `/metrics/[name]` such as `/metrics/jvm.memory.used`.

See the documentation for https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-micrometer/latest/guide/[Micronaut Micrometer] for a list of registries and information on how to configure, expose and customize metrics output.
