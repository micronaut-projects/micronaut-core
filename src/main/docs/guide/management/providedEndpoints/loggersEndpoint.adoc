The loggers endpoint returns information about the available loggers in the application and permits configuring their log level.

NOTE: The loggers endpoint is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled with the setting `endpoints.loggers.enabled=true`.

To get a collection of all loggers by name with their configured and effective log levels, send a GET request to /loggers. This also provides a list of the available log levels.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/loggers

{
    "levels": [
        "ALL", "TRACE", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "OFF", "NOT_SPECIFIED"
    ],
    "loggers": {
        "ROOT": {
            "configuredLevel": "INFO",
            "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
        },
        "io": {
            "configuredLevel": "NOT_SPECIFIED",
            "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
        },
        "io.micronaut": {
            "configuredLevel": "NOT_SPECIFIED",
            "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
        },
        // etc...
    }
}
----

To get the log levels of a particular logger, include the logger name in your GET request. For example, to access the log levels of the logger 'io.micronaut.http':

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/loggers/io.micronaut.http

{
    "configuredLevel": "NOT_SPECIFIED",
    "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
}
----

If the named logger does not exist, it is created with an unspecified (i.e. `NOT_SPECIFIED`) configured log level (its effective log level is usually that of the root logger).

To update the log level of a single logger, send a POST request to the named logger URL and include a body providing the log level to configure.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -X POST \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{ "configuredLevel": "ERROR" }' \
       http://localhost:8080/loggers/ROOT

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

$ curl http://localhost:8080/loggers/ROOT

{
    "configuredLevel": "ERROR",
    "effectiveLevel": "ERROR"
}
----

== Configuration

To configure the loggers endpoint, supply configuration through `endpoints.loggers`.

.Loggers Endpoint Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  loggers:
    enabled: Boolean
    sensitive: Boolean
----

NOTE: By default, the endpoint doesn't allow changing the log level by unauthorized users (even if `sensitive` is set to `false`). To allow this you must set `endpoints.loggers.write-sensitive` to `false`.

== Customization

The loggers endpoint is composed of two customizable parts: a api:management.endpoint.loggers.LoggersManager[] and a api:logging.LoggingSystem[]. See the <<logging, logging section of the documentation>> for information on customizing the logging system.

The api:management.endpoint.loggers.LoggersManager[] is responsible for retrieving and setting log levels. If the default implementation is not sufficient for your use case, simply provide your own implementation and replace the api:management.endpoint.loggers.impl.DefaultLoggersManager[default implementation] with the ann:context.annotation.Replaces[] annotation.
