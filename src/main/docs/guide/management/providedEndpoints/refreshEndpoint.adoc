The refresh endpoint refreshes the application state, causing all link:{api}/io/micronaut/runtime/context/scope/Refreshable.html[Refreshable] beans in the context to be destroyed and reinstantiated upon further requests. This is accomplished by publishing a api:runtime.context.scope.refresh.RefreshEvent[] in the Application Context.

To execute the refresh endpoint, send a POST request to /refresh.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/refresh
----

When executed without a body, the endpoint first refreshes the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/Environment.html[Environment] and performs a diff to detect any changes, and then only performs the refresh if changes are detected. To skip this check and refresh all `@Refreshable` beans regardless of environment changes (e.g., to force refresh of cached responses from third-party services), add a `force` parameter in the POST request body.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/refresh -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"force": true}'
----

== Configuration

To configure the refresh endpoint, supply configuration through `endpoints.refresh`.
