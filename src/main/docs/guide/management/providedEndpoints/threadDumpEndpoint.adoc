The routes endpoint returns information about the threads running in your application.

To execute the routes endpoint, send a GET request to /threaddump.

== Configuration

To configure the threaddump endpoint, supply configuration through `endpoints.threaddump`.

.Routes Endpoint Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
    threaddump:
        enabled: Boolean
        sensitive: Boolean
----

== Customization

The thread dump endpoint delegates to a link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/endpoint/threads/ThreadInfoMapper.html[ThreadInfoMapper]) that is responsible for transforming the `java.lang.management.ThreadInfo` objects into any other to be sent for serialization.
