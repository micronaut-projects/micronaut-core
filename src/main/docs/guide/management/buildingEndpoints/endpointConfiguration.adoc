Endpoints with the `endpoints` prefix can be configured through their default endpoint id. If an endpoint exists with the id of `foo`, it can be configured through `endpoints.foo`. In addition, default values can be provided through the `all` prefix.

For example, consider the following endpoint.

[source,java]
.FooEndpoint.java
----
@Endpoint("foo")
class FooEndpoint {
    ...
}
----

By default the endpoint is enabled. To disable it, set `endpoints.foo.enabled` to false. If `endpoints.foo.enabled` is not set and `endpoints.all.enabled` is `false`, the endpoint will be disabled.

The configuration values for the endpoint override those for `all`. If `endpoints.foo.enabled` is `true` and `endpoints.all.enabled` is `false`, the endpoint will be enabled.

For all endpoints, the following configuration values can be set.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
  <any endpoint id>:
    enabled: Boolean
    sensitive: Boolean
----

NOTE: The base path for all endpoints is `/` by default. If you prefer the endpoints to be available under a different base path, configure `endpoints.all.path`. For example, if the value is set to `/endpoints`, the foo endpoint will be accessible at `/endpoints/foo`.
