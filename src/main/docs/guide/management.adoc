[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you create your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `management` feature to configure the management endpoints in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features management
----
====

Inspired by Spring Boot and Grails, the Micronaut `management` dependency adds support for monitoring of your application via *endpoints*: special URIs that return details about the health and state of your application. The `management` endpoints are also integrated with Micronaut's `security` dependency, allowing for sensitive data to be restricted to authenticated users in your security system (see https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#builtInEndpointsAccess[Built-in Endpoints Access] in the Security section).

To use the `management` features described in this section, add this dependency to your build:

dependency:micronaut-management[]
