Micronaut supports internationalization (i18n) by allowing it's applications to resolve text messages written in different languages and locales.  Messages are usually grouped by locale and 
accessed through key/value pairs in properties files named for that language and locale.  These properties files are referred to as resource bundles.

MessageSource is an interface for resolving messages from some defined source.  In Micronaut's context, i18n messages are retrieved from resource bundles using the class ResourceBundleMessageSource.

Let's look at an example where our application should greet a person based on their locale.
1. Create resource bundles for each language/locale i.e. English, Spanish, French, etc.
2. Create a bean to retrieve the proper messages bundle.
3. If a message bundle is not found, display the default messages bundle.
