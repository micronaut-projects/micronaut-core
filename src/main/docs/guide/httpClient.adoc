A critical component of any Microservice architecture is the client communication between Microservices. With that in mind Micronaut features a built in HTTP client that has both a low-level API and a higher level AOP-driven API.

TIP: Regardless whether you choose to use Micronaut's HTTP server, you may wish to use the Micronaut HTTP client in your application since it is a feature-rich client implementation

To use the HTTP client you must have the `http-client` dependency on your classpath. For example in `build.gradle`:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
compile "io.micronaut:http-client"
----

Since the higher level API is built on the low-level HTTP client, we will first introduce the low-level client.
