Client communication between Microservices is a critical component of any Microservice architecture. With that in mind, Micronaut framework includes an HTTP client that has both a low-level API and a higher-level AOP-driven API.

TIP: Regardless whether you choose to use Micronaut's HTTP server, you may wish to use the Micronaut HTTP client in your application since it is a feature-rich client implementation.
