A bean is an object whose lifecycle is managed by the Micronaut IoC container. That lifecycle may include creation, execution, and destruction. Micronaut implements the https://javax-inject.github.io/javax-inject/[JSR-330 (jakarta.inject) - Dependency Injection for Java] specification, hence to use Micronaut you simply use the link:{jakartaapi}/jakarta/inject/package-summary.html[annotations provided by jakarta.inject].

The following is a simple example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.Engine,io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.V8Engine,io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.Vehicle[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> A common `Engine` interface is defined
<2> A `V8Engine` implementation is defined and marked with `Singleton` scope
<3> The `Engine` is injected via constructor injection

To perform dependency injection, run the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/BeanContext.html[BeanContext] using the `run()` method and lookup a bean using `getBean(Class)`, as per the following example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.VehicleSpec[tags="start",indent="0"]

The Micronaut framework automatically discovers dependency injection metadata on the classpath and wires the beans together according to injection points you define.

The Micronaut framework supports the following types of dependency injection:

* Constructor injection (must be one public constructor or a single constructor annotated with `@Inject`)
* Field injection
* JavaBean property injection
* Method parameter injection

NOTE: Classes or particular fields, methods can be excluded by adding an annotation ann:core.annotation.Vetoed[]
