A bean is an object whose lifecycle is managed by the Micronaut IoC container. That lifecycle may include creation, execution, and destruction. Micronaut implements the https://javax-inject.github.io/javax-inject/[JSR-330 (jakarta.inject) - Dependency Injection for Java] specification, hence to use Micronaut you simply use the link:{jakartaapi}/jakarta/inject/package-summary.html[annotations provided by jakarta.inject].

The following is a simple example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.Engine,io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.V8Engine,io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.Vehicle[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> A common `Engine` interface is defined
<2> A `V8Engine` implementation is defined and marked with `Singleton` scope
<3> The `Engine` is injected via constructor injection

To perform dependency injection, run the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/BeanContext.html[BeanContext] using the `run()` method and lookup a bean using `getBean(Class)`, as per the following example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.VehicleSpec[tags="start",indent="0"]

The Micronaut framework automatically discovers dependency injection metadata on the classpath and wires the beans together according to injection points you define.
