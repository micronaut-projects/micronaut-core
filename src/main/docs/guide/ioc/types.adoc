In addition to being able to inject beans Micronaut natively supports injecting the following types:


.Injectable Container Types
|===
|Type |Description |Example

|link:{jdkapi}/java/util/Optional.html[java.util.Optional]
|An `Optional` of a bean. If the bean doesn't exist `empty()` is injected
|`Optional<Engine>`

|link:{jdkapi}/java/lang/Iterable.html[java.lang.Iterable]
|An `Iterable` or subtype of `Iterable` (example `List`, `Collection` etc.)
|`Iterable<Engine>`

|link:{jdkapi}/java/util/stream/Stream.html[java.util.stream.Stream]
|A lazy `Stream` of beans
|`Stream<Engine>`

|link:{jdkapi}/java/lang/reflect/Array.html[Array]
|A native array of beans of a given type
|`Engine[]`

|link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Provider.html[Provider]
|A `javax.inject.Provider` if a circular dependency requires it or to instantiate a prototype for each `get` call.
|`Provider<Engine>`

|===

TIP: A prototype bean will have one instance created per place the bean is injected. When a prototype bean is injected as a `Provider`, each call to `get()` will create a new instance.
