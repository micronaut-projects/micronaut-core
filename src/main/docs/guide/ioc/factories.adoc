In many cases, you may want to make available as a bean a class that is not part of your codebase such as those provided by third-party libraries. In this case, you cannot annotate the compiled class. Instead, implement a ann:context.annotation.Factory[].

A factory is a class annotated with the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html[Factory] annotation that provides one or more methods annotated with a bean scope annotation. Which annotation you use depends on what scope you want the bean to be in. See the section on <<scopes, bean scopes>> for more information.

The return types of methods annotated with a bean scope annotation are the bean types. This is best illustrated by an example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.factories.CrankShaft,io.micronaut.docs.factories.V8Engine,io.micronaut.docs.factories.EngineFactory[tags="class",indent=0]

In this case, a `V8Engine` is created by the `EngineFactory` class' `v8Engine` method. Note that you can inject parameters into the method and they will be resolved as beans. The resulting `V8Engine` bean will be a singleton.

A factory can have multiple methods annotated with bean scope annotations, each one returning a distinct bean type.

NOTE: If you take this approach you should not invoke other bean methods internally within the class. Instead, inject the types via parameters.

TIP: To allow the resulting bean to participate in the application context shutdown process, annotate the method with link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Bean.html[@Bean] and set the `preDestroy` argument to the name of the method to be called to close the bean.

=== Programmatically Disabling Beans

Factory methods can throw api:context.exceptions.DisabledBeanException[] to conditionally disable beans. Using ann:context.annotation.Requires[] should always be the preferred method to conditionally create beans; throwing an exception in a factory method should only be done if using ann:context.annotation.Requires[] is not possible.

For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.factories.nullable.Engine,io.micronaut.docs.factories.nullable.EngineConfiguration,io.micronaut.docs.factories.nullable.EngineFactory[tags="class",indent=0]

=== Injection Point

A common use case with factories is to take advantage of annotation metadata from the point at which an object is injected such that behaviour can be modified based on said metadata.

Consider an annotation such as the following:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.injectionpoint.Cylinders[tags="class",indent=0]

The above annotation could be used to customize the type of engine we want to inject into a vehicle at the point at which the injection point is defined:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.injectionpoint.Vehicle[tags="class",indent=0]

The above `Vehicle` class specifies an annotation value of `@Cylinders(6)` indicating an `Engine` of six cylinders is required.

To implement this use case, define a factory that accepts the api:inject.InjectionPoint[] instance to analyze the defined annotation values:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.injectionpoint.EngineFactory[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> The factory method defines a parameter of type api:inject.InjectionPoint[].
<2> The annotation metadata is used to obtain the value of the `@Cylinder` annotation
<3> The value is used to construct an engine, throwing an exception if an engine cannot be constructed.

NOTE: It is important to note that the factory is declared as ann:context.annotation.Prototype[] scope so the method is invoked for each injection point. If the `V8Engine` and `V6Engine` types are required to be singletons, the factory should use a Map to ensure the objects are only constructed once.
