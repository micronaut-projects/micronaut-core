In many cases, you may want to make available as a bean a class that is not part of your codebase such as those provided by third-party libraries. In this case, you cannot annotate the already compiled class. Instead, you should implement a link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html[Factory].

A factory is a class annotated with the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html[Factory] annotation that provides 1 or more methods annotated with a bean scope annotation. Which annotation you use depends on what scope you want the bean to be in. See the section on <<scopes, bean scopes>> for more information.

The return types of methods annotated with a bean scope annotation are the bean types. This is best illustrated by an example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.factories.CrankShaft,io.micronaut.docs.factories.V8Engine,io.micronaut.docs.factories.EngineFactory[tags="class",indent=0]

In this case, the `V8Engine` is built by the `EngineFactory` class' `v8Engine` method. Note that you can inject parameters into the method and these parameters will be resolved as beans. The resulting `V8Engine` bean will be a singleton.

A factory can have multiple methods annotated with bean scope annotations, each one returning a distinct bean type.

NOTE: If you take this approach, then you should not invoke other bean methods internally within the class. Instead, inject the types via parameters.

TIP: To allow the resulting bean to participate in the application context shutdown process, annotate the method with link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Bean.html[@Bean] and set the `preDestroy` argument to the name of the method that should be called to close the bean.
