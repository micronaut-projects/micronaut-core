If you have multiple possible implementations for a given interface to inject, you need to use a qualifier.

Once again Micronaut leverages JSR-330 and the link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Qualifier.html[Qualifier] and link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Named.html[Named] annotations to support this use case.

== Qualifying By Name

To qualify by name, use the link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Named.html[Named] annotation. For example, consider the following classes:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.qualifiers.named.Engine,io.micronaut.docs.inject.qualifiers.named.V6Engine,io.micronaut.docs.inject.qualifiers.named.V8Engine,io.micronaut.docs.inject.qualifiers.named.Vehicle[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> The `Engine` interface defines the common contract
<2> The `V6Engine` class is the first implementation
<3> The `V8Engine` class is the second implementation
<4> The link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Named.html[javax.inject.Named] annotation indicates that the `V8Engine` implementation is required
<5> Calling the start method prints: `"Starting V8"`

Micronaut is capable of injecting `V8Engine` in the previous example, because:

`@Named` qualifier value (`v8`) + type being injected simple name (`Engine`) == (case-insensitive) == The simple name of a bean of type `Engine` (`V8Engine`)

You can also declare link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Named.html[@Named] at the class level of a bean to explicitly define the name of the bean.

== Qualifying By Annotation

In addition to being able to qualify by name, you can build your own qualifiers using the link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Qualifier.html[Qualifier] annotation. For example, consider the following annotation:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.annotation.V8[tags="imports,class",indent=0]

The above annotation is itself annotated with the `@Qualifier` annotation to designate it as a qualifier. You can then use the annotation at any injection point in your code. For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.annotation.Vehicle[tags="constructor",indent=0]

== Qualifying By Annotation Members

Since Micronaut 3.0, annotation qualifiers can also use annotation members to resolve the correct bean to inject. For example, consider the following annotation:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.annotationmember.Cylinders[tags="imports,class",indent=0]

<1> The `@Cylinders` annotation is meta-annotated with `@Qualifier`
<2> The annotation has two members. The ann:context.annotation.NonBinding[] annotation is used to exclude the `description` member from being considered during dependency resolution.

You can then use the `@Cylinders` annotation on any bean and the members that are not annotated with ann:context.annotation.NonBinding[] are considered during dependency resolution:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.annotationmember.V6Engine[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> Here the `value` member is set to 6 for the `V6Engine` type
<2> The class implements an `Engine` interface

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.annotationmember.V8Engine[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> Here the `value` member is set to 8 for the `V6Engine` type
<2> The class implements an `Engine` interface

You can then use the `@Cylinders` qualifier on any injection point to select the correct bean to inject. For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.annotationmember.Vehicle[tags="constructor",indent="0"]

== Qualifying by Generic Type Arguments

Since Micronaut 3.0, it is possible to select which bean to inject based on the generic type arguments of the class or interface. Consider the following example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.generics.CylinderProvider[tags="class",indent=0]

The `CylinderProvider` interface provides the number of cylinders.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.generics.Engine[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> The engine class defines a generic type argument `<T>` that must be an instance of `CylinderProvider`

You can define implementations of the `Engine` interface with different generic type arguments. For example for a V6 engine:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.generics.V6[tags="class",indent=0]

The above defines a `V6` class that implements the `CylinderProvider` interface.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.generics.V6Engine[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> The `V6Engine` implements `Engine` providing `V6` as a generic type parameter

And a V8 engine:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.generics.V8[tags="class",indent=0]

The above defines a `V8` class that implements the `CylinderProvider` interface.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.generics.V8Engine[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> The `V8Engine` implements `Engine` providing `V8` as a generic type parameter

You can then use the generic arguments when defining the injection point and Micronaut will pick the correct bean
to inject based on the specific generic type arguments:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.generics.Vehicle[tags="constructor",indent=0]

In the above example the `V8Engine` bean is injected.

== Primary and Secondary Beans

api:context.annotation.Primary[] is a qualifier that indicates that a bean is the primary bean to be selected in the case of multiple interface implementations.

Consider the following example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.annotation.primary.ColorPicker[tags="clazz", indent=0]

`ColorPicker` is implemented by these classes:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.annotation.primary.Green[tags="imports,clazz", indent=0, title="The Primary Bean"]

The `Green` bean class implements `ColorPicker` and is annotated with `@Primary`.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.annotation.primary.Blue[tags="imports,clazz", indent=0, title="Another Bean of the Same Type"]

The `Blue` bean class also implements `ColorPicker` and hence you have two possible candidates when injecting the `ColorPicker` interface. Since `Green` is the primary, it will always be favoured.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.annotation.primary.TestController[tags="clazz", indent=0]

<1> Although there are two `ColorPicker` beans, `Green` gets injected due to the `@Primary` annotation.

If multiple possible candidates are present and no `@Primary` is defined a api:context.exceptions.NonUniqueBeanException[] is thrown.

In addition to `@Primary`, there is also a api:context.annotation.Secondary[] annotation which causes the opposite effect and allows de-prioritizing a bean.

== Injecting Any Bean

If you are not particular about which bean gets injected then you can use the ann:annotation.Any[] qualifier which will inject the first available bean, for example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.any.VehicleSpec[tags="any", indent=0, title="Injecting Any Instance"]

The ann:annotation.Any[] qualifier is typically used in conjunction with the api:context.BeanProvider[] interface to allow more dynamic use cases. For example the following `Vehicle` implementation will start the `Engine` if the bean is present:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.any.Vehicle[tags="imports,clazz", indent=0, title="Using BeanProvider with Any"]

<1> Use `@Any` to inject the api:context.BeanProvider[]
<2> Call the `start` method if the underlying bean is present using the `ifPresent` method

If there are multiple beans you can also adapt the behaviour. The following example starts all the engines installed in the `Vehicle` if any are present:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.any.Vehicle[tags="startAll", indent=0, title="Using BeanProvider with Any"]

<1> Check if any beans present
<2> If so iterate over each one via the `stream().forEach(..)` method, starting the engines
