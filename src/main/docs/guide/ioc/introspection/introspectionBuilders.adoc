If a type can only be constructed via the builder pattern then you can use the `builder` member of the ann:core.annotation.Introspected[] annotation to generate a dynamic builder. For example given this class:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.builders.Person[tags="class"]

You can use the `builder()` method of the api:core.beans.BeanIntrospection[] API to construct the instance:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.builders.IntrospectionBuilderSpec[tags="builder", indent=0]

TIP: The `builder()` method also works regardless if the type uses a builder and can be used as a general abstraction for object construction. Note however that there is a slight performance overhead vs direct instantiation via the `instantiate()` method, hence the `hasBuilder()` method can be checked if optimized code paths are needed.

NOTE: Introspection Builder does not work with https://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html#xform-Builder[Groovy `@Builder` AST].
