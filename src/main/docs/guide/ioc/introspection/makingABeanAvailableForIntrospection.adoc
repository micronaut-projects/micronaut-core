Unlike the JDK's jdk:java.beans.Introspector[], every class is not automatically available for introspection. To make a class available for introspection you must at a minimum enable Micronaut's annotation processor (`micronaut-inject-java` for Java and Kotlin and `micronaut-inject-groovy` for Groovy) in your build and ensure you have a runtime time dependency on `micronaut-core`.

dependency::micronaut-inject-java[scope="annotationProcessor"]

NOTE: For Kotlin, add the `micronaut-inject-java` dependency in `kapt` scope, and for Groovy add `micronaut-inject-groovy` in `compileOnly` scope.

dependency::micronaut-core[scope="runtimeOnly"]

Once your build is configured you have a few ways to generate introspection data.
