Since 4.1.x the ann:context.annotation.Mapper[] annotation can be used on any abstract method to automatically create a mapping between one type and another.

Inspired by similar functionality in libraries like https://mapstruct.org[Map Struct], a `Mapper` uses the <<introspections, Bean Introspection>> and <<evaluatedExpressions, Expressions>> features, built into the Micronaut Framework, which are already reflection free.

NOTE: For Mapping, base and target types need to be <<introspection, introspected>>.

=== @Mapper Example

Given the following types:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.mappers.ContactForm[tags="class"]

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.mappers.ContactEntity[tags="class"]

You can write an interface to define a mapping between both types by simply annotating a method with ann:context.annotation.Mapper[].

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.mappers.ContactMappers[tags="imports, class"]

The Micronaut compiler generates an implementation the previous an interface at compilation-time.

You can then inject a bean of type `ContactMappers` and easily map from one type to another.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.mappers.SimpleMapperSpec[tags="mappers", indent=0]

=== @Mapping Example

Each abstract method can define a single ann:context.annotation.Mapper[@Mapper] annotation or one or many ann:context.annotation.Mapper.Mapping[@Mapping] annotations to define how properties map onto the target type.

For example, given the following type:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.mappers.Product[tags="class"]

It is common to want to alter this type's representation in HTTP responses. For example, consider this response type:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.mappers.ProductDTO[tags="class"]

Here the `price` property is of a different type and an extra property exists called `distributor`. You could write manual logic to deal the mapping and these differences, or you could define a mapping:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.mappers.ProductMappers[tags="class"]

The `from` member can be used to define either a property name on the source type or an <<evaluatedExpressions, expression>> that reads values from the method argument and transforms them in whatever way you choose, including invoking other methods of the instance.

NOTE: A `@Mapping` definition is only needed if you need to apply a transformation for the mapping to be successful. Other properties will be automatically mapped and converted.

You can retrieve from the context or inject a bean of type `ProductMappers`. Then, you can use the `toProductDTO` method  to map from the Product type to the ProductDTO type:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.mappers.MappersSpec[tags="mappers", indent="0"]
