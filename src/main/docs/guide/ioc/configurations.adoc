A bean link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Configuration.html[@Configuration] is a grouping of multiple bean definitions within a package.

The `@Configuration` annotation is applied at the package level and informs Micronaut that the beans defined with the package form a logical grouping.

The `@Configuration` annotation is typically applied to `package-info` class. For example:

.package-info.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
@Configuration
package my.package

import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Configuration
----

Where this grouping becomes useful is when the bean configuration is made conditional via the `@Requires` annotation. For example:

.package-info.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
@Configuration
@Requires(beans = javax.sql.DataSource)
package my.package
----

In the above example, all bean definitions within the annotated package will only be loaded and made available if a `javax.sql.DataSource` bean is present. This allows you to implement conditional auto-configuration of bean definitions.

=== Configuration Requirements

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Requires.html[@Requires] annotation is very flexible and can be used for a variety of use cases. The following table summarizes some of the possibilities:


.Using @Requires
|===
|Requirement | Example

|Require the presence of one ore more classes
|`@Requires(classes=javax.servlet.Servlet)`

|Require the presence one or more beans
|`@Requires(beans=javax.sql.DataSource)`

|Require the presence of an environment variable
|`@Requires(env='TRAVIS')`

|Require the presence of another configuration package
|`@Requires(configuration='foo.bar')`

|Require particular SDK version
|`@Requires(sdk=Sdk.JAVA, value="1.8")`

|Require a property with an optional value
|`@Requires(property='data-source.url')`
