At times you may want a bean to load conditionally based on various potential factors including the classpath, the configuration, the presence of other beans etc.

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Requires.html[Requires] annotation provides the ability to define one or many conditions on a bean.

Consider the following example:

.Using @Requires
[source,java]
----
include::{testsjava}/requires/JdbcBookService.java[tags=requires, indent=0]
}
----

The above bean defines two requirements. The first indicates that a `DataSource` bean must be present for the bean to load. The second requirement ensures that the `datasource.url` property is set before loading the `JdbcBookService` bean.

NOTE: Kotlin currently does not support repeatable annotations. Use the `@Requirements` annotation when multiple requires are needed. For example, `@Requirements(Requires(...), Requires(...))`. See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-12794 to track this feature.

If you have multiple requirements that you find you may need to repeat on multiple beans then you can define a meta-annotation with the requirements:


.Using a @Requires meta-annotation
[source,java]
----
include::{testsjava}/requires/RequiresJdbc.java[tags=annotation, indent=0]
----

In the above example an annotation called `RequiresJdbc` is defined that can then be used on the `JdbcBookService` instead:

.Using a @Requires meta-annotation
[source,java]
----
@RequiresJdbc
public class JdbcBookService implements BookService {
    ...
}
----

If you have multiple beans that need to fulfill a given requirement before loading then you may want to consider a bean configuration group, as explained in the next section.

== Configuration Requirements

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Requires.html[@Requires] annotation is very flexible and can be used for a variety of use cases. The following table summarizes some of the possibilities:


.Using @Requires
|===
|Requirement | Example

|Require the presence of one ore more classes
|`@Requires(classes=javax.servlet.Servlet)`

|Require the absence of one ore more classes
|`@Requires(missing=javax.servlet.Servlet)`

|Require the presence one or more beans
|`@Requires(beans=javax.sql.DataSource)`

|Require the absence of one or more beans
|`@Requires(missingBeans=javax.sql.DataSource)`

|Require the environment to be applied
|`@Requires(env="test")`

|Require the environment to not be applied
|`@Requires(notEnv="test")`

|Require the presence of another configuration package
|`@Requires(configuration="foo.bar")`

|Require the absence of another configuration package
|`@Requires(missingConfigurations="foo.bar")`

|Require particular SDK version
|`@Requires(sdk=Sdk.JAVA, value="1.8")`

|Requires classes annotated with the given annotations to be available to the application via package scanning
|`@Requires(entities=javax.persistence.Entity)`

|Require a property with an optional value
|`@Requires(property="data-source.url")`

|Require a property to not be part of the configuration
|`@Requires(missingProperty="data-source.url")`

|Requires the presence of one of more files in the file system
|`@Requires(resources="file:/path/to/file")`

|Requires the presence of one of more classpath resources
|`@Requires(resources="classpath:myFile.properties")`
|===

=== Additional Notes on Property Requirements.

Adding a requirement on a property has some additional functionality. You can require the property to be a certain value, not be a certain value, and use a default in those checks if its not set.

[source,java]
----
@Requires(property="foo") //<1>
@Requires(property="foo", value="John") //<2>
@Requires(property="foo", value="John", defaultValue="John") //<3>
@Requires(property="foo", notEquals="Sally") //<4>
----

<1> Requires the property to be "yes", "YES", "true", "TRUE", "y" or "Y"
<2> Requires the property to be "John"
<3> Requires the property to be "John" or not set
<4> Requires the property to not be "Sally" or not set

== Debugging Conditional Beans

If you have multiple conditions and complex requirements it may become difficult to understand why a particular bean has not been loaded.

To help resolve issues with conditional beans you can enable debug logging for the `io.micronaut.context.condition` package which will log the reasons why beans were not loaded.

.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<logger name="io.micronaut.context.condition" level="DEBUG"/>
----
