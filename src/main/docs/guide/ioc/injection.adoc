The Micronaut framework supports the following types of dependency injection:

* Constructor injection (must be one public constructor or a single constructor annotated with `@Inject`)
* Field injection
* JavaBean property injection
* Method parameter injection

NOTE: Classes or particular fields, methods can be excluded by adding an annotation ann:core.annotation.Vetoed[]
