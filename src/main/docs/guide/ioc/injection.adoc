The Micronaut framework supports the following types of dependency injection:

* Constructor injection (with an access level of public, protected, or default - and in case of multiple constructors, you can specify the one to be chosen, annotating it with `@Inject`)
* Field injection
* JavaBean property injection
* Method parameter injection

NOTE: Classes or particular fields, methods can be excluded by adding an annotation ann:core.annotation.Vetoed[]
