Since Micronaut 1.2, Micronaut has built-in support for validating beans that are annotated with `javax.validation` annotations. As a minimum you should include the `micronaut-validation` module as a compile dependency:

dependency::micronaut-validation[]

Note that Micronaut's implementation is not currently fully compliant with the https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/[Bean Validator specification] as the specification heavily relies on reflection-based APIs.

The following features are unsupported at this time:

* Annotations on generic argument types since only the Java language supports this feature.
* Any interaction with the https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/#constraintmetadata[constraint metadata API], since Micronaut uses already computed compilation time metadata.
* XML-based configuration
* Instead of using `javax.validation.ConstraintValidator` you should use api:validation.validator.constraints.ConstraintValidator[] (io.micronaut.validation.validator.constraints.ConstraintValidator) to define custom constraints, which supports validating annotations at compilation time.

Micronaut's implementation includes the following benefits:

* Reflection and Runtime Proxy free validation resulting in reduced memory consumption
* Smaller JAR size since Hibernate Validator adds another 1.4MB
* Faster startup since Hibernate Validator adds 200ms+ startup overhead
* Configurability via Annotation Metadata
* Support for Reactive Bean Validation
* Support for validating the source AST at compilation time
* Automatic compatibility with GraalVM native without additional configuration

If you require full Bean Validator 2.0 compliance you can add the `micronaut-hibernate-validator` module to your classpath, which will replace Micronaut's implementation.

=== Validating Bean Methods

You can validate methods of any class declared as a Micronaut bean simply by using the `javax.validation` annotation as arguments:

.Validating Methods
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.PersonService[tags="imports,class",indent=0]

The above example declares that the `@NotBlank` annotation should be validated when executing the `sayHello` method.

WARNING: If you are using Kotlin the class and method must be declared open so that Micronaut can create a compilation time subclass, alternatively you can annotate the class with ann:validation.Validated[] and configure the Kotlin `all-open` plugin to open classes annotated with this type. See the https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html[Compiler plugins] section.

If a validation error occurs a `javax.validation.ConstraintViolationException` will be thrown. For example:

.ConstraintViolationException Example
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.PersonServiceSpec[tags="imports,test",indent=0]

<1> The method is called with a blank string
<2> An exception occurs

=== Validating Data Classes

If you wish to validate data classes, such as POJOs and so on, typically used in JSON interchange, the class must be annotated with ann:core.annotation.Introspected[] (see the previous section on <<introspection, Bean Introspection>>) or, if the class is external, be imported by the `@Introspected` annotation.

.POJO Validation Example
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.Person[tags="class"]

TIP: The ann:core.annotation.Introspected[] annotation can be used as a meta-annotation and common annotations like `@javax.persistence.Entity` are treated as `@Introspected`

The above example defines a class called `Person` that has 2 properties (`name` and `age`) that have constraints applied to them. Note that in Java the annotations can be on the field or the getter and with Kotlin data classes the annotation should target the field.

If you wish to validate the class manually then you can inject an instance of api:validation.validator.Validator[]:

.Manual Validation Example
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.pojo.PersonServiceSpec[tags="validator", indent="0"]

<1> The validator is used to validate the person
<2> The constraint violations are verified

Alternatively on Bean methods you can use `javax.validation.Valid` to trigger cascading validation:

.ConstraintViolationException Example
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.pojo.PersonService[tags="class",indent="0"]

The `PersonService` will now validate the `Person` class when invoked:

.Manual Validation Example
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.pojo.PersonServiceSpec[tags="validate-service",indent="0"]

<1> A validated method is invoked
<2> The constraint violations are verified


=== Validating Configuration Properties

You can also validate the properties of classes that are annotated with ann:context.annotation.ConfigurationProperties[] to ensure configuration is correct.

NOTE: It is recommended that you annotate ann:context.annotation.ConfigurationProperties[] that features validation with ann:context.annotation.Context[] to ensure that the validation occurs at startup time.

=== Defining Additional Constraints

To define additional constraints you can define a new annotation, for example:

.Example Constraint Annotation
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.custom.DurationPattern[tags="imports,class", indent="0"]

<1> The annotation should be annotated with `javax.validation.Constraint`
<2> A `message` template can be provided in a hard coded manner as above. If none is specified Micronaut will try to find a message using `ClassName.message` using the api:context.MessageSource[] interface. (optional)
<3> To support repeated annotations you can define a inner annotation (optional).

TIP: You can add messages and message bundles using the api:context.MessageSource[] and api:context.i18n.ResourceBundleMessageSource[] classes.

Once you have defined the annotation you need to implement a api:validation.validator.constraints.ConstraintValidator[] that validates the annotation. You can either implement a bean that implements the interface directly or define a factory that returns one or more validators.

The latter approach is recommended if you plan to define multiple validators:

.Example Constraint Validator
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.custom.MyValidatorFactory[tags="imports,class", indent="0"]

The above example implements a validator that validates any field, parameter etc. that is annotated with `DurationPattern`, ensuring that the string can be parsed with `java.time.Duration.parse`.

NOTE: Generally `null` is regarded as valid and `@NotNull` used to constrain a value as not being `null`. The example above regards `null` as a valid value.

For example:

.Example Custom Constraint Usage
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.custom.HolidayService[tags="class", indent="0"]

To verify the above examples validates the `duration` parameter you can define a test:


.Testing Example Custom Constraint Usage
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.custom.DurationPatternValidatorSpec[tags="test", indent="0"]

<1> A validated method is invoked
<2> THe constraint violations are verified

=== Validating Annotations at Compilation Time

You can use Micronaut's validator to validate annotation usages at compilation time. To do so you should include `micronaut-validation` in the annotation processor classpath:

dependency::micronaut-validation[scope="annotationProcessor"]

Once this is done Micronaut will at compilation validate annotation values that are themselves annotated with `javax.validation`. For example consider the following annotation:

.Annotation Validation
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.custom.TimeOff[tags="imports,class", indent="0"]

If your attempt to use `@TimeOff(duration="junk")` in your source Micronaut will fail compilation due to the value of `duration` violating the `DurationPattern` constraint.

NOTE: If `duration` is a property placeholder such as `@TimeOff(duration="${my.value}")` then validation handling will be deferred until runtime.

Note that if you wish to allow use of a custom `ConstraintValidator` at compilation time you should instead define the validator as a class:

.Example Constraint Validator
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.validation.custom.DurationPatternValidator[tags="imports,class", indent="0"]

In addition to the following requirements:

* Define a `META-INF/services/io.micronaut.validation.validator.constraints.ConstraintValidator` file that references the class.
* The class should be public and feature a zero argument public constructor
* The class should be placed on the annotation processor classpath of the project that is to be validated.
