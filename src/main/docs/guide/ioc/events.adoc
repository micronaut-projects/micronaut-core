You can hook into the creation of beans using one of the following interfaces:

* link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/event/BeanInitializedEventListener.html[BeanInitializedEventListener] - allows modifying or replacing a bean after properties have been set but prior to `@PostConstruct` event hooks.
* link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener] - allows modifying or replacing a bean after the bean is fully initialized and all `@PostConstruct` hooks called.

The `BeanInitializedEventListener` interface is commonly used in combination with link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html[Factory] beans. Consider the following example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.events.factory.V8Engine,io.micronaut.docs.events.factory.EngineFactory,io.micronaut.docs.events.factory.EngineInitializer[tags="class",indent=0]

<1> The `V8Engine` class defines a `rodLength` property
<2> The `EngineFactory` initializes the value of `rodLength` and creates the instance
<3> The created instance is returned as a link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Bean.html[Bean]
<4> The `BeanInitializedEventListener` interface is implemented to listen for the initialization of the factory
<5> Within the `onInitialized` method the `rodLength` is overridden prior to the engine being created by the factory bean.

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/event/BeanCreatedEventListener.html[BeanCreatedEventListener] interface is more typically used to decorate or enhance a fully initialized bean, for example by creating a proxy.

IMPORTANT: Bean event listeners are initialized *before* type converters. If your event listener relies on type conversion either by relying on a configuration properties bean or by any other mechanism, you may see errors related to type conversion.
