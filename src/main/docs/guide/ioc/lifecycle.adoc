== When The Context Starts

To invoke a method when a bean is constructed, use the `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` annotation:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.lifecycle.V8Engine[tags="imports, class", indent=0]

<1> The `PostConstruct` annotation is imported
<2> A field is defined that requires initialization
<3> A method is annotated with `@PostConstruct` and will be invoked once the object is constructed and fully injected.

To manage when a bean is constructed, see the section on <<scopes, bean scopes>>.

== When The Context Closes

To invoke a method when the context is closed, use the `javax.annotation.PreDestroy` annotation:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.lifecycle.PreDestroyBean[tags="class", indent=0]

<1> The `PreDestroy` annotation is imported
<2> A method is annotated with `@PreDestroy` and will be invoked when the context is closed.

For factory beans, the `preDestroy` value in the api:context.annotation.Bean[] annotation tells Micronaut which method to invoke.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.lifecycle.ConnectionFactory[tags="class", indent=0]

'''

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.lifecycle.Connection[tags="class", indent=0]

<1> The `preDestroy` value is set on the annotation
<2> The annotation value matches the method name

NOTE: Simply implementing the `Closeable` or `AutoCloseable` interface is not enough for a bean to be closed with the context. One of the above methods must be used.
