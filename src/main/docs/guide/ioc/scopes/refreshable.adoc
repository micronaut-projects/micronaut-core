The api:runtime.context.scope.Refreshable[] scope is a custom scope that allows a beanâ€™s state to be refreshed via:

- `/refresh` endpoint.
- Publication of a api:runtime.context.scope.refresh.RefreshEvent[].

The following example illustrates `@Refreshable` scope behavior.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.scope.RefreshEventSpec[tags="weatherService",indent="0"]

<1> The `WeatherService` is annotated with `@Refreshable` scope which stores an instance until a refresh event is triggered
<2> The value of the `forecast` property is set to a fixed value when the bean is created and won't change until the bean is refreshed

If you invoke `latestForecast()` twice, you will see identical responses such as `"Scattered Clouds 01/Feb/18 10:29.199"`.

When the `/refresh` endpoint is invoked or a api:runtime.context.scope.refresh.RefreshEvent[] is published, the instance is invalidated and a new instance is created the next time the object is requested. For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.scope.RefreshEventSpec[tags="publishEvent",indent="0"]
