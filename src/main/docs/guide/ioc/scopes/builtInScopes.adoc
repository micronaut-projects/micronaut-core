.Micronaut Built-in Scopes
|===
|Type |Description

|link:{jeeapi}/javax/inject/Singleton.html[@Singleton]
|Singleton scope indicates only one instance of the bean should exist
|link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Context.html[@Context]
|Context scope indicates that the bean should be created at the same time as the `ApplicationContext` (eager initialization)
|link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Prototype.html[@Prototype]
|Prototype scope indicates that a new instance of the bean is created each time it is injected
|link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Infrastructure.html[@Infrastructure]
|Infrastructure scope represents a bean that cannot be overridden or replaced using ann:context.annotation.Replaces[] because it is critical to the functioning of the system.
|link:{api}/io/micronaut/runtime/context/scope/ThreadLocal.html[@ThreadLocal]
|`@ThreadLocal` scope is a custom scope that associates a bean per thread via a ThreadLocal
|link:{api}/io/micronaut/runtime/context/scope/Refreshable.html[@Refreshable]
|`@Refreshable` scope is a custom scope that allows a bean's state to be refreshed via the `/refresh` endpoint.
|link:{api}/io/micronaut/runtime/http/scope/RequestScope.html[@RequestScope]
|`@RequestScope` scope is a custom scope that indicates a new instance of the bean is created and associated with each HTTP request
|===

NOTE: The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Prototype.html[@Prototype] annotation is a synonym for link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Bean.html[@Bean] because the default scope is prototype.

Additional scopes can be added by defining a `@Singleton` bean that implements the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/scope/CustomScope.html[CustomScope] interface.

Note that with Micronaut when starting an api:context.ApplicationContext[] by default `@Singleton` scoped beans are created lazily and on demand. This is by design and to optimize startup time.

If this presents a problem for your use case you have the option of using the ann:context.annotation.Context[] annotation which binds the lifecycle of your object to the lifecycle of the api:context.ApplicationContext[]. In other words when the api:context.ApplicationContext[] is started your bean will be created.

Alternatively you can annotate any `@Singleton` scoped bean with ann:context.annotation.Parallel[] which allows parallel initialization of your bean without impacting overall startup time.

NOTE: If your bean fails to initialize in parallel then the application will be automatically shutdown.
