You can inject methods by annotating the method with `jakarta.inject.Inject`. For each argument of the method Micronaut will attempt to resolve the method argument as a bean. If any of the methods are not resolvable a api:context.exceptions.NoSuchBeanException[] will be thrown.

.Example of Method Injection

<1> The method is annotated with `jakarta.inject.Inject` and will therefore be injected

WARNING: If the method is `private` scope or inaccessible then the method will be injected using the Java reflection API which is not recommended.

Method injection can be useful if you need post construction initializers, however in general should be avoided in favour of constructor injection where possible.
