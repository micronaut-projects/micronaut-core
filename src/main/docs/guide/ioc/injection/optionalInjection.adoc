An alternative to ann:core.annotation.Nullable[], is to make the injection optional (not to be confused with `java.util.Optional`). This can be done with the ann:context.annotation.Autowired[] annotation by setting the `required` member to `false`:

<1> `@Autowired(required=false)` is declared making the injection optional.

This approach differs to using ann:core.annotation.Nullable[] since in this case if the bean is not available the injection point will not be invoked and `null` won't be injected.

However, it important to note that ann:context.annotation.Autowired[] can only be applied for method and field injection. Optional injection cannot be applied to constructor injection, because there is no way to make a constructor argument optional.
