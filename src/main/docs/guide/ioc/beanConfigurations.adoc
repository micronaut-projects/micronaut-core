A bean link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Configuration.html[@Configuration] is a grouping of multiple bean definitions within a package.

The `@Configuration` annotation is applied at the package level and informs the Micronaut framework that the beans defined with the package form a logical grouping.

The `@Configuration` annotation is typically applied to `package-info` classes. For example:

.package-info.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
@Configuration
package my.package

import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Configuration
----

Where this grouping becomes useful is when the bean configuration is made conditional via the `@Requires` annotation. For example:

.package-info.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
@Configuration
@Requires(beans = javax.sql.DataSource)
package my.package
----

In the above example, all bean definitions within the annotated package are only loaded and made available if a `javax.sql.DataSource` bean is present. This lets you implement conditional autoconfiguration of bean definitions.

NOTE: Java and Kotlin also support this functionality via `package-info.java`. Kotlin does not support a `package-info.kt` as of version 1.3.
