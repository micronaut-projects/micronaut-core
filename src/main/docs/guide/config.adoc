Configuration in Micronaut takes inspiration from both Spring Boot and Grails, integrating configuration properties from multiple sources directly into the core IoC container.

Configuration can by default be provided in Java properties, YAML, JSON, or Groovy files. The convention is to search for a file named `application.yml`, `application.properties`, `application.json` or `application.groovy`.

In addition, like Spring and Grails, Micronaut allows overriding any property via system properties or environment variables.

Each source of configuration is modeled with the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/PropertySource.html[PropertySource] interface and the mechanism is extensible, allowing the implementation of additional link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/PropertySourceLoader.html[PropertySourceLoader] implementations.
