Micronaut features a flexible configuration mechanism that allows reading configuration from a variety of sources into a unified model that can be bound to Java types annotated with <<configurationProperties, @ConfigurationProperties>>.

Configuration can by default be provided in Java properties files or https://www.json.org/json-en.html[JSON] with the ability to add support for more formats (such as YAML or Groovy configuration) by adding addition third-party libraries to your classpath. The convention is to search for a file named `application.properties` or `application.json` with support for other formats requiring additional dependencies as described by the following table:

.Supported Configuration Formats
|===
|Format|File|Dependency Required

| https://yaml.org[YAML]
|`application.yml`
|`org.yaml:snakeyaml`

| https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-groovy/latest/guide/#config[Groovy Config]
|`application.groovy`
|`io.micronaut.groovy:micronaut-runtime-groovy`

|https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md[HOCON]
|`application.conf`
|`io.micronaut.kotlin:micronaut-kotlin-runtime`

|https://toml.io/en/[TOML]
|`application.toml`
|`io.micronaut.toml:micronaut-toml`

|===


In addition, Micronaut framework allows overriding any property via system properties or environment variables.

Each source of configuration is modeled with the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/PropertySource.html[PropertySource] interface and the mechanism is extensible, allowing the implementation of additional link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/PropertySourceLoader.html[PropertySourceLoader] implementations.
