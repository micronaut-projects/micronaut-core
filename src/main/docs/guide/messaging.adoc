In the past, with monolithic applications, message listeners that listened to messages from messaging systems would frequently be embedded in the same application unit.

In Microservice architectures it is common to have individual Microservice applications that are driven by a message system such as RabbitMQ or Kafka.

In fact a Message-driven Microservice may not even feature an HTTP endpoint or HTTP server (although this can be valuable from a health check and visibility perspective).
