As you can see, the Micronaut framework features a robust system for externalizing and adapting configuration to the environment inspired by similar approaches in Grails and Spring Boot.

However, what if you want multiple microservices to share configuration? the Micronaut framework includes APIs for distributed configuration.

The api:discovery.config.ConfigurationClient[] interface has a `getPropertySources` method that can be implemented to read and resolve configuration from distributed sources.

The `getPropertySources` returns a rs:Publisher[] that emits zero or many api:context.env.PropertySource[] instances.

The default implementation is api:discovery.config.DefaultCompositeConfigurationClient[] which merges all registered `ConfigurationClient` beans into a single bean.

You can either implement your own api:discovery.config.ConfigurationClient[] or use the implementations provided by Micronaut. The following sections cover those.
