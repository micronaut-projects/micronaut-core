https://www.consul.io[Consul] is a popular Service Discovery and Distributed Configuration server provided by HashiCorp. Micronaut features a native api:discovery.consul.client.v1.ConsulClient[] that uses Micronaut's support for <<clientAnnotation, Declarative HTTP Clients>>.

== Starting Consul

The quickest way to start using Consul is via Docker:

. Starting Consul with Docker
[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 8500:8500 consul
----

Alternatively you can https://www.consul.io/docs/install/index.html[install and run a local Consul instance].

== Enabling Distributed Configuration with Consul

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you create your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `config-consul` feature to enable Consul's distributed configuration in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features config-consul
----
====

To enable distributed configuration, similar to Spring Boot and Grails, create a `src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml` configuration file to configure Consul, and enable the configuration client:

.bootstrap.yml
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  application:
    name: hello-world
  config-client:
    enabled: true
consul:
  client:
    defaultZone: "${CONSUL_HOST:localhost}:${CONSUL_PORT:8500}"
----

After enabling distributed configuration, store the configuration to share in Consul's key/value store. There are a number of ways to do that.

== Storing Configuration as Key/Value Pairs

One way is to store the keys and values directly in Consul. In this case by default Micronaut looks for configuration in the Consul `/config` directory.

TIP: You can alter the path searched for by setting `consul.client.config.path`

Within the `/config` directory Micronaut searches values within the following directories in order of precedence:

.Configuration Resolution Precedence
|===
|Directory|Description

|`/config/application`
|Configuration shared by all applications

|`/config/application,prod`
|Configuration shared by all applications for the `prod` api:context.env.Environment[]

|`/config/[APPLICATION_NAME]`
|Application-specific configuration, example `/config/hello-world`

|`/config/[APPLICATION_NAME],prod`
|Application-specific configuration for an active api:context.env.Environment[]

|===

The value of `APPLICATION_NAME` is whatever your have configured `micronaut.application.name` to be in `bootstrap.yml`.

To see this in action, use the following cURL command to store a property called `foo.bar` with a value of `myvalue` in the directory `/config/application`.

.Using cURL to Write a Value
[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT -d @- localhost:8500/v1/kv/config/application/foo.bar <<< myvalue
----

If you now define a `@Value("${foo.bar}")` or call `environment.getProperty(..)` the value `myvalue` will be resolved from Consul.

== Storing Configuration in YAML, JSON etc.

Some Consul users prefer storing configuration in blobs of a certain format, such as YAML. Micronaut supports this mode and supports storing configuration in either YAML, JSON, or Java properties format.

TIP: The api:discovery.config.ConfigDiscoveryConfiguration[] has a number of configuration options for configuring how distributed configuration is discovered.

You can set the `consul.client.config.format` option to configure the format with which properties are read.

For example, to configure JSON:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
consul:
  client:
    config:
      format: JSON
----

Now write your configuration in JSON format to Consul:

.Using cURL to write JSON
[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT  localhost:8500/v1/kv/config/application \
-d @- << EOF
{ "foo": {  "bar": "myvalue" } }
EOF
----

== Storing Configuration as File References

Another popular option is https://github.com/breser/git2consul[git2consul] which mirrors the contents of a Git repository to Consul's key/value store.

You can setup a Git repository that contains files like `application.yml`, `hello-world-test.json`, etc., and the contents of these files will be cloned to Consul.

In this case, each key in Consul represents a file with an extension, for example `/config/application.yml`, and you must configure the `FILE` format:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
consul:
  client:
    config:
      format: FILE
----
