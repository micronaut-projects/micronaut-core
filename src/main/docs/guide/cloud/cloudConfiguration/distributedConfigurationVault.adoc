Micronaut integrates with https://www.vaultproject.io/[HashiCorp Vault] as a distributed configuration source.

To enable support for Vault Configuration, create a `src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml` configuration file and add the following configuration:

.Integrating with HashiCorp Vault
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  application:
    name: hello-world
  config-client:
    enabled: true

vault:
  client:
    config:
      enabled: true
----

See the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-discovery-client/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.discovery.vault.config.VaultClientConfiguration[configuration reference] for all configuration options.

Micronaut uses the configured `micronaut.application.name` to lookup property sources for the application from Vault.
