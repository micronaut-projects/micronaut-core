Since 1.1, Micronaut features a native https://www.vaultproject.io/[HashiCorp Vault] for those who have not switched to a dedicated more complete solution like Consul.

To enable support for Vault Configuration simply add the following configuration to your `bootstrap.yml` file:

.Integrating with HashiCorp Vault
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    application:
        name: hello-world
    config-client:
        enabled: true

vault:
    client:
        config:
            enabled: true
        uri: http://192.168.1.88:8200   # default value: http://locahost:8200
        token: ${VAULT_TOKEN}           # Usually set as environment variable
        kv-version: V1                  # default value: V1
        backend: backendv1              # default value: secret
        fail-fast: false
        retry-attempts: 4               # optional, number of times to retry
        retry-delay: 2s                 # optional, delay between retries
----

Micronaut will use the configured `micronaut.application.name` to lookup property sources for the application from Vault configured via `vault.client.uri`.

See the https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/kv/index.html[Documentation for HashiCorp Vault] for more information on how to setup the server.
