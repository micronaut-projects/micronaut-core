Since 1.1, Micronaut features a native https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-config[Spring Cloud Configuration] for those who have not switched to a dedicated more complete solution like Consul.

To enable support for Spring Cloud Configuration, add the following configuration to your `bootstrap.yml` file:

.Integrating with Spring Cloud Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  application:
    name: hello-world
  config-client:
    enabled: true
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      enabled: true
      uri: http://localhost:8888/
      retry-attempts: 4 # optional, number of times to retry
      retry-delay: 2s # optional, delay between retries
----

Micronaut uses the configured `micronaut.application.name` to look up property sources for the application from Spring Cloud config server configured via `spring.cloud.config.uri`.

See the https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-config#learn[Documentation for Spring Cloud Config Server] for more information on how to set up the server.
