[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `netflix-ribbon` feature to configure Netflix Ribbon in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features netflix-ribbon
----

https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon[Netflix Ribbon] is a inter-process communication library used at Netflix that has support for customizable load balancing strategies.

If you need more flexibility in how your application performs client-side load balancing then you may wish use Micronaut's Netflix Ribbon support.

To add Ribbon support to your application add the `netflix-ribbon` configuration to `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`:

dependency:io.micronaut.netflix:micronaut-netflix-ribbon[]

The api:http.client.LoadBalancer[] implementations will now be api:configuration.ribbon.RibbonLoadBalancer[] instances.

Ribbon's http://netflix.github.io/ribbon/ribbon-core-javadoc/com/netflix/client/config/CommonClientConfigKey.html[Configuration options] can be set using the `ribbon` namespace in configuration. For example in `application.yml`:

.Configuring Ribbon
[source,yaml]
----
ribbon:
  VipAddress: test
  ServerListRefreshInterval: 2000
----

Each discovered client can also be configured under `ribbon.clients`. For example given a `@Client(id = "hello-world")` you can configure Ribbon settings with:

.Per Client Ribbon Settings
[source,yaml]
----
ribbon:
  clients:
    hello-world:
      VipAddress: test
      ServerListRefreshInterval: 2000
----

By default Micronaut registers a api:configuration.ribbon.DiscoveryClientServerList[] for each client that integrates Ribbon with Micronaut's api:discovery.DiscoveryClient[].
