When <<serviceDiscovery, discovering services>> from Consul, Eureka, or other Service Discovery servers, the api:discovery.DiscoveryClient[] emits a list of available api:discovery.ServiceInstance[].

The Micronaut framework by default automatically performs Round Robin client-side load balancing using the servers in this list. This combined with <<retry, Retry Advice>> adds extra resiliency to your Microservice infrastructure.

The load balancing is handled by the api:http.client.LoadBalancer[] interface, which has a api:http.client.LoadBalancer.select()[] method that returns a `Publisher` which emits a api:discovery.ServiceInstance[].

The rs:Publisher[] is returned because the process for selecting a api:discovery.ServiceInstance[] may result in a network operation depending on the <<serviceDiscovery, Service Discovery>> strategy employed.

The default implementation of the api:http.client.LoadBalancer[] interface is api:http.client.loadbalance.DiscoveryClientRoundRobinLoadBalancer[]. You can replace this strategy with another implementation to customize how client side load balancing is handled in Micronaut, since there are many different ways to optimize load balancing.

For example, you may wish to load balance between services in a particular zone, or to load balance between servers that have the best overall response time.

To replace the api:http.client.LoadBalancer[], define a bean that <<replaces, replaces>> the api:http.client.loadbalance.DiscoveryClientLoadBalancerFactory[].

In fact that is exactly what the Netflix Ribbon support does, described in the next section.
