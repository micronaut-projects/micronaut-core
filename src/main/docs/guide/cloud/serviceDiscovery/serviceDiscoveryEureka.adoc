https://github.com/Netflix/eureka[Netflix Eureka] is a popular discovery server deployed at scale at organizations like Netflix.

Micronaut features a native non-blocking api:discovery.eureka.client.v2.EurekaClient[] as part of the `discovery-client` module that does not require any additional third-party dependencies and is built using Micronaut's support for <<clientAnnotation, Declarative HTTP Clients>>.

== Starting Eureka

The quickest way to start a Eureka server is to use to use https://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/#initial[Spring Boot's Eureka starters].

NOTE: As of this writing the official Docker images for Eureka are significantly out-of-date so it is recommended to create a Eureka server following the steps above.

== Auto Registering with Eureka

The process to register a Micronaut application with Eureka is very similar to with Consul, as seen in the previous section, simply add the necessary api:discovery.eureka.EurekaConfiguration[]. A minimal example can be seen below:

.Auto Registering with Eureka (application.yml)
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    application:
        name: hello-world
eureka:
  client:
    registration:
      enabled: true
    defaultZone: "${EUREKA_HOST:localhost}:${EUREKA_PORT:8761}"
----

== Customizing Eureka Service Registration

You can customize various aspects of registration with Eureka using the api:discovery.eureka.EurekaConfiguration[]. Notice that `EurekaConfiguration` extends api:discovery.client.DiscoveryClientConfiguration[]  which in turn extends api:http.client.HttpClientConfiguration[] allowing you to customize the settings for the Eureka client, including read timeout, proxy configuration and so on.

.Example Eureka Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
eureka:
  client:
     readTimeout: 5s
     registration:
         asgName: myAsg # the auto scaling group name
         countryId: 10 # the country id
         vipAddress: 'myapp' # The Eureka VIP address
         leaseInfo:
            durationInSecs: 60 # The lease information
         metadata: # arbitrary instance metadata
            foo: bar
         retry-count: 10 # How many times to retry
         retry-delay: 5s # How long to wait between retries
----

== Eureka Basic Authentication

You can customize the Eureka credentials in the URI you specify to in `defaultZone`.

For example:

.Auto Registering with Eureka
[source,yaml]
----
eureka:
  client:
    defaultZone: "https://${EUREKA_USERNAME}:${EUREKA_PASSWORD}@localhost:8761"
----

The above example externalizes configuration of the username and password Eureka to environment variables called `EUREKA_USERNAME` and `EUREKA_PASSWORD`.

== Eureka Health Checks

Like Consul, the api:discovery.eureka.registration.EurekaAutoRegistration[] will send api:health.HeartbeatEvent[] instances with the api:health.HealthStatus[] of the Micronaut application to Eureka.

The api:management.health.monitor.HealthMonitorTask[] will by default continuously monitor the api:health.HealthStatus[] of the application by running health checks and the api:health.CurrentHealthStatus[] will be sent to Eureka.

== Secure Communication with Eureka

If you wish to configure HTTPS and have clients discovery Eureka instances and communicate over HTTPS then you should set the `eureka.client.discovery.use-secure-port` option to `true` to ensure that service communication happens over HTTPS and also configure <<https, HTTPS>> appropriately for each instance.
