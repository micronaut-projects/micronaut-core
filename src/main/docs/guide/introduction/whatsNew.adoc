//Micronaut {version} includes the following changes:

== 3.7.0

Several improvements:

- If you want complete control of where your application loads configuration from, for example, due to security restrictions, you can disable the default https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/guide/#propertySource[`PropertySourceLoader`] implementations by calling `ApplicationContextBuilder::enableDefaultPropertySources(false)` when starting your application.

- Better `java.time` conversion for YAML configuration

- Client SSL inner configuration is https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#bootstrap[Bootstrap] context compatible.

- https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/http/uri/UriBuilder.html[`UriBuilder`] methods `queryParam` and `replaceQueryParam` ignore null values.

- It is possible to stop the Netty server without stopping the Application context.

- You can declare beans at runtime using interfaces.

- You can mark static methods as `@Executable`.

- A big HTTP client refactor.

**Spring integration improvements**

- https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-spring/latest/guide/[Micronaut Spring] contains improvements for developers who want to use Micronaut modules with a Spring application or consume Spring libraries from a Micronaut application.

=== @Scheduled with Time Zones

Optionally, you can specify a time zone when using the <<scheduling,`@Scheduled` annotation>>.

[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(cron = '1/33 0/1 * 1/1 * ?', zoneId = "America/Chicago")
void runCron() {
...
..
----

=== Support validation groups with `@Validated`

You can enforce a subset of constraints using <<validationGroups,validation groups>> using groups on the `@Validated`.

=== Advanced Listener Configuration

Micronaut framework 3.5.0 offers more flexibility in configuring the HTTP Server. Instead of configuring a single port, you
<<listener,can specify each listener manually>>.

=== EPHEMERAL FACTORIES

=== Micronaut Security

https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-security/releases/tag/v3.4.0[Micronaut Security 3.4.1] responds with an error when an authenticated user visits a sensitive endpoint. This forces the developer to define how they want their application to behave in that scenario. Read the https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-security/releases/tag/v3.4.0[release notes] and the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#builtInEndpointsAccess[documentation] to learn more.

=== BOM Modules

Several projects include a BOM (Bills of Materials) module:

- https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-azure/releases/tag/v3.1.0[Micronaut Azure 3.1.0]
- https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gcp/releases/tag/v4.1.0[Micronaut GCP 4.1.0]. It includes updates to the latest versions of Google Cloud dependencies.
- https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-kotlin/releases/tag/v3.2.0[Micronaut Kotlin 3.2.0]

== 3.3.0

=== GraalVM 22.0.0.2

Micronaut now supports the latest GraalVM 22.0.0.2 release.

=== Environment Endpoint

A new API api:management.endpoint.env.EnvironmentEndpointFilter[] has been created to allow applications to customize which keys should have their values masked and which keys should not have their values masked. See the <<environmentEndpoint, documentation>> for full details.

=== AOP Interceptor Binding

When binding an AOP annotation to an interceptor, only the presence of the annotation is used to determine if the interceptor should be applied. Now it's possible to also bind based on the values of the annotation. To enable this feature, set the `bindMembers` member of the ann:aop.InterceptorBinding[] annotation to `true`.

=== Netty Buffer Allocation

It is now possible to configure the default Netty buffer allocator. See the https://docs.micronaut.io/3.3.x/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.buffer.netty.DefaultByteBufAllocatorConfiguration[configuration reference].

=== Improved Flexibility in Class Style

Many features of the Micronaut framework rely on the convention of getters and setters. Due to things like records and builders, the method names we look for are now configurable with the ann:core.annotation.AccessorsStyle[] annotation. For example, the annotation can be placed on ann:context.annotation.ConfigurationProperties[] beans to allow for binding configuration to methods that do not begin with `set`. It can also be used with classes annotated with ann:core.annotation.Introspected[].

=== Access Log Exclusions

The Netty access logger now supports excluding requests based on a set of regular expression patterns that match against the URI. See the <<accessLogger,AccessLogger documentation>>.

=== New Serialization/Deserialization Module

https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-serialization/1.0.x/guide/[Micronaut Serialization] is a new module created as an alternative to Jackson. It supports serializing and deserializing Java types (including Java 17 records) to and from JSON and other formats.

Users now have the choice of an alternative implementation that's largely compatible with existing Jackson annotations but contains many benefits, including the elimination of reflection, compile-time validation, greater security because only explicit types are serializable, and reduction of native image build sizes, build times, and memory usage.

=== New Email Module

https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-email/latest/guide/[Micronaut Email] is a new module to ease sending emails from a Micronaut application. It provides integration with transactional email providers such as Amazon Simple Email Service, Postmark, Mailjet or SendGrid.

=== Micronaut AOT

During this minor cycle, we released a milestone release of a new module Micronaut AOT. You can use Micronaut AOT and use the build-time optimizations provided by the module to achieve faster startup times via the Micronaut Gradle Plugin. Please, read more about it in the https://micronaut.io/2021/12/20/micronaut-aot-build-time-optimizations-for-micronaut-applications/[announcement blog post].

=== Micronaut Kubernetes 3.3.0

Micronaut Kubernetes 3.3 adds support to easily create the Kubernetes Operator. The Kubernetes Operator is a known pattern used to extend the capabilities of Kubernetes by creating application specific controllers for both native and custom resources. See more on https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-kubernetes/latest/guide/#kubernetes-operator[Kubernetes Operator].

The version of Micronaut Kubernetes 3.3.0 also adds new Kubernetes reactive client for RxJava3.

== 3.2.0

=== GraalVM 21.3.0

Micronaut has been updated to support the latest GraalVM 21.3.0 release. Please keep in mind that starting with 21.3.0 GraalVM doesn't release a version based on JDK 8. If you still use Java 8 use the GraalVM JDK 11 distribution.

The official GraalVM Maven plugin has new GAV coordinates so if you have declared it in your `pom.xml` update the coordinates to:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
    <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
...
</plugin>
----

Please check https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/0.9.7.1/maven-plugin.html[the official documentation] about how to customize the plugin.

=== Gradle Plugin 3.0.0

A new major version of the Gradle plugin has been released, including internal changes to use Gradle's lazy configuration APIs.
In the process, https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gradle-plugin/latest/[documentation] has been rewritten.

Support for GraalVM now delegates to https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/0.9.7.1/gradle-plugin.html[the official GraalVM plugin].
We recommend to upgrade in order to get the latest bugfixes, but this constitutes a breaking change for some users:

- the `nativeImage` task is now replaced with `nativeCompile`
- native image configuration happens in the `graalvmNative` DSL extension instead of the `nativeCompile` task
- native image building makes use of Gradle's toolchain support. Please refer to the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gradle-plugin/latest/[documentation] for help.

NOTE: You can still build existing applications or libraries using the 2.x version of the Gradle plugin. Documentation for this version can be found https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin/blob/2.0.x/README.md[here].

=== Kotlin 1.6.0

Micronaut 3.2.0 includes support for Kotlin 1.6.0.

=== HTTP Features

==== WebSocket Ping API

WebSocket ann:websocket.annotation.OnMessage[] methods can now accept a api:websocket.WebSocketPongMessage[] parameter that will receive a WebSocket pong sent as a response to a ping submitted using the new `sendPingAsync` method on api:websocket.WebSocketSession[].

==== HTTP2 Server Push

It is now possible to send resources, e.g. stylesheets required by a HTML page, to the client alongside the request for the page using the HTTP2 server push protocol. See the <<http2Server, HTTP/2 documentation>> for information on how to use this feature.

==== JsonView on request bodies

You can now specify the Jackson `@JsonView` annotation on `@Body` parameters to controller methods.

==== WebSocket ws/wss protocol support

The WebSocket clients now support the ws/wss protocol. To implement this change, the api:websocket.WebSocketClient[] `create` methods now take a `URI` instead of a `URL`. The `URL` methods have been deprecated.

Note: Should you be calling `WebSocketClient.create(null)`, the method call is now ambiguous. Insert a cast in that case: `WebSocketClient.create((URI) null)`

==== SSL handshake timeout configuration

The SSL handshake timeout can now be configured using the `micronaut.ssl.handshakeTimeout` and `micronaut.http.client.ssl.handshakeTimeout` configurations for the server and client respectively.

=== Module Upgrades

==== Micronaut Data 3.2.0

- Repositories with JPA Criteria API specification for Micronaut JDBC/R2DBC

==== Micronaut Micrometer 4.1.0

- Adds support for metrics with gRPC

==== Micronaut Security 3.2.0

- The way JSON Web Key Sets are being cached has been greatly improved for scenarios where there are multiple key sets.

==== Other Module Upgrades

- Elasticsearch 7.15.2
- Flyway 8.0.2
- gRPC 1.39.0

- Micronaut Redis 5.1.0
- Testcontainers 1.16.1

== 3.1.0

=== Core Features

==== Primitive Beans

<<factories, Factory Beans>> can now create beans that are primitive types or primitive array types.

See the section on <<factories, Primitive Beans and Arrays>> in the documentation for more information.

==== Repeatable Qualifiers

<<qualifiers, Qualifiers>> can now be repeatable (an annotation annotated with `java.lang.annotation.Repeatable`) allowing narrowing bean resolution by a complete or partial match of the qualifiers declared on the injection point.

==== InjectScope

A new ann:context.annotation.InjectScope[] annotation has been added which destroys any beans with no defined scope and injected into a method or constructor annotated with `@Inject` after the method or constructor completes.

==== More Build Time Optimizations

Further build time metadata optimizations have been added included reducing the number and size of the classes generated to support <<introspection, Bean Introspection>> and including knowledge of repeatable annotations in generated metadata avoiding further reflective calls and optimizing Micronaut's memory usage, in particular with GraalVM.

==== Improvements to Context Propagation

Support for <<context,Reactive context propagation>> has been further improved by inclusion of request context information in the https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#context[Reactor context] and <<kotlinContextPropagation, documentation on how to effectively propagate the context across reactive flows>> when using Kotlin coroutines.

==== Improvements to the Element API

The build-time api:inject.ast.Element[] API has been improved in a number of ways:

* New methods were added to the api:inject.ast.MethodElement[] API to resolve the retriever type and throws declaration
* A new experimental API has been added to the api:inject.ast.ClassElement[] API  to resolve generic placeholders and resolve the generic bound to the element

=== HTTP Features

==== Filter By Regex

HTTP filters now support matching URLs by a regular expression. Set the `patternStyle` member of the annotation to `REGEX` and the value will be treated as a regular expression.

==== Random Port Binding

The way the server binds to random ports has improved and should result in fewer port binding exceptions in tests.

==== Client Data Formatting

The ann:core.convert.format.Format[] annotation now supports several new values that can be used in conjunction with the declarative HTTP client to support formatting data in several new ways. See the <<clientParameters, client parameters>> documentation for more information.

==== StreamingFileUpload

The api:http.multipart.StreamingFileUpload[] API has been improved to support streaming directly to an output stream. As with the other `transferTo` methods, the write to the stream is offloaded to the IO pool automatically.

==== Server SSL Configuration

The SSL configuration for the Netty server now responds to refresh events. This allows for swapping out certificates without having to restart the server. See the <<https, https documentation>> for information on how to trigger the refresh.

==== New Netty Server API

If you wish to programmatically start additional Netty servers on different ports with potentially different configurations, new APIs have been added to do so including a new api:http.server.netty.NettyEmbeddedServerFactory[] interface.

See the documentation on <<secondaryServers, Starting Secondary Servers>> for more information.

=== Deprecations

The `netty.responses.file.\*` configuration is deprecated in favor of `micronaut.server.netty.responses.file.*`. The old configuration key will be removed in the next major version of the framework.

Micronaut Kubernetes 3.1 introduces new annotation https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-kubernetes/latest/api/io/micronaut/kubernetes/client/informer/Informer.html[@Informer]. By using the annotation on the https://javadoc.io/doc/io.kubernetes/client-java/latest/io/kubernetes/client/informer/ResourceEventHandler.html[ResourceEventHandler] the Micronaut will instantiate the https://javadoc.io/doc/io.kubernetes/client-java/latest/io/kubernetes/client/informer/SharedIndexInformer.html[SharedInformer] from the official https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java[Kubernetes Java SDK]. Then you only need to take care of handling the changes of the watched Kubernetes resource. See more on https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-kubernetes/latest/guide/#kubernetes-informer[Kubernetes Informer].

==== Micronaut Oracle Coherence 3.0.0

The https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-coherence/latest/guide/[Micronaut Oracle Coherence] module is now out of preview status and includes broad integration with Oracle Coherence including support for caching, messaging and Micronaut Data.

=== Core Features

==== Optimized Build-Time Metadata

Micronaut 3.0 introduces a new build time metadata format that is more efficient in terms of startup and code size.

The result is significant improvements to startup and native image sizes when building native images with GraalVM Native Image.

It is recommended that users re-compile their applications and libraries with Micronaut 3.0 to benefit from these changes.

==== Support for GraalVM 21.2

Micronaut has been updated to support the latest GraalVM 21.2 release.

==== Jakarta Inject

The `jakarta.inject` annotations are now the default injection annotations for Micronaut 3

==== Support for JSR-330 Bean Import

Using the ann:context.annotation.Import[] annotation it is now possible to import bean definitions into your application where JSR-330 (either `javax.inject` or `jakarta.inject` annotations) are used in an external library.

See the documentation on <<beanImport, Bean Import>> for more information.

==== Support for Controlling Annotation Inheritance

api:core.annotation.AnnotationMetadata[] inheritance can now be controlled via Java's `@Inherited` annotation. If an annotation is not explicitly annotated with `@Inherited` it will not be included in the metadata. See the <<annotationMetadata, Annotation Inheritance>> section of the documentation for more information.

NOTE: This is an important behavioural change from Micronaut 2.x, see the <<breaks, Breaking Changes>> section for information on how to upgrade.

==== Support Narrowing Injection by Generic Type Arguments

Micronaut can now resolve the correct bean to inject based on the generic type arguments specified on the injection point:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.generics.Vehicle[tags="constructor",indent=0]

For more information see the section on <<qualifiers, Qualifying by Generic Type Arguments>>.

==== Support for using Annotation Members in Qualifiers

You can now use annotation members in qualifiers and specify which members should be excluded with the new ann:context.annotation.NonBinding[] annotation.

For more information see the section on <<qualifiers, Qualifying By Annotation Members>>.

==== Support for Limiting the Injectable Types

You can now limit the exposed types of a bean using the `typed` member of the ann:context.annotation.Bean[] annotation:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.typed.V8Engine[tags="class",indent=0]

For more information see the section on <<typed, Limiting Injectable Types>>.

==== Factories can produce bean from fields

Beans defined with the ann:context.annotation.Factory[] annotation can now produce beans from public or package protected fields, for example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.factories.VehicleMockSpec[tags="class",indent=0]

For more information see the <<factories, Bean Factories>> section of the documentation.

==== Enhanced `BeanProvider` Interface

The api:context.BeanProvider[] interface has been enhanced with new methods such as `iterator()` and `stream()` as well as methods to check for bean existence and uniqueness.

==== New `@Any` Qualifier for use in Bean Factories

A new ann:context.annotation.Any[] qualifier has been introduced to allow injecting any available instance into an injection point and can be used in combination with the new `BeanProvider` interface mentioned above to allow more dynamic behaviour.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.qualifiers.any.Vehicle[tags="imports,clazz", indent=0, title="Using BeanProvider with Any"]

The annotation can also be used on ann:context.annotation.Factory[] methods to allow customization of how objects are injected via the api:inject.InjectionPoint[] API.

==== Support for Fields in Bean Introspections

Bean introspections on public or package protected fields are now supported:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.ioc.beans.User[tags="class", indent=0]

For more information see the "Bean Fields" section of the <<introspection, Bean Introspections>> documentation.

==== `ApplicationEventPublisher` has now a generic event type

For the performance reasons it's advised to inject an instance of `ApplicationEventPublisher` with a generic type parameter - `ApplicationEventPublisher<MyEvent>`.

=== AOP Features

==== Support for Constructor Interception

It is now possible to intercept bean construction invocations through the api:aop.ConstructorInterceptor[] interface and ann:aop.AroundConstruct[] annotation.

See the section on <<lifecycleAdvice, Bean Life Cycle Advice>> for more information.

==== Support for `@PostConstruct` & `@PreDestroy` Interception

It is now possible to intercept `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` method invocations through the api:aop.MethodInterceptor[] interface and ann:aop.InterceptorBinding[] annotation.

See the section on <<lifecycleAdvice, Bean Life Cycle Advice>> for more information.


==== Random Configuration Values

It is now possible to set a max and a range for random numbers in configuration. For example to set an integer between 0 and 9, `${random.int(10)}` can be used as the configuration value. See the <<propertySource, documentation>> under "Using Random Properties" for more information.

==== Project Reactor used internally instead of RxJava2

Micronaut 3 uses internally https://projectreactor.io[Project Reactor] instead https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava 2]. Project Reactor allows
Micronaut 3 to simplify instrumentation, thanks to https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/util/context/Context.html[Reactor's Context],  simplifies conversion login and eases the integration with R2DBC drivers. We recommend users to migrate to Reactor. However, it is possible to continue to use RxJava. See <<reactiveConfigs, Reactive Programming section>>.
