Micronaut {version} includes the following changes:

=== Core Features

==== IO Stream Support

It is now possible to define a body argument of a controller method with an InputStream. For example `@Body InputStream inputStream`. Note that you must offload the execution to another thread pool to avoid blocking the event loop when reading the stream. `InputStream` can also be returned from controller methods. The stream will be read by Micronaut on the IO thread pool if the controller method is executed on the event loop.

==== HTTP to HTTPS redirect with Dual Protocol

If Dual Protocol is enabled, now it is possible to redirect all HTTP requests automatically to the HTTPS port. See more information <<dualProtocol, about how to enable and configure it>>.

==== GraalVM 21.1.0 Support

Micronaut has been updated to support the latest GraalVM 21.1.0 release with the Gradle and Maven plugins now defaulting to 21.1.0.

==== Support for JDK 16 and Gradle 7.0 in Micronaut Launch

https://micronaut.io/launch/[Micronaut Launch] has been updated with support for JDK 16 and Gradle 7.0.

==== Random Configuration Values

It is now possible to set a max and a range for random numbers in configuration. For example to set an integer between 0 and 9, `${random.int(10)}` can be used as the configuration value. See the <<propertySource, documentation>> under "Using Random Properties" for more information.
