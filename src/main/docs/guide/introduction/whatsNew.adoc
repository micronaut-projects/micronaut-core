Micronaut {version} includes the following changes:

=== Core Features

==== Jakarta Inject

The `jakarta.inject` inject annotations are now supported as an alternative to `javax.inject`. Micronaut 3 will change the default inject annotations to Jakarta, however the javax annotations will continue to be supported if added to your build explicitly.

Micronaut 3 will change the bean context API to return our custom provider contract, api:context.BeanProvider[]. We suggest existing applications to change to use that interface instead of `javax.inject.Provider`, however both the `jakarta.inject.Provider` and `javax.inject.Provider` interfaces will continue to be supported.

==== Core Nullability Annotations

With the future of JSR-305 unclear and issues with regards to the module system with existing solutions, Micronaut 2.4 will replace usages of Spotbugs with core nullability annotations: ann:core.annotation.Nullable[] and ann:core.annotation.NotNull[].

Existing applications should switch to using these annotations. If other annotations are preferable, the dependency should be added explicitly to your build because no third party `Nullable` or `NonNull` annotations will be available transitively in the next major version.

==== Official Kubernetes Client

With the new `micronaut-kubernetes-client` module you can now inject apis objects from the https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java[official Kubernetes Java SDK] as regular beans.

In Micronaut 3 this new module will be used as primary kubernetes client, making the current one deprecated.
