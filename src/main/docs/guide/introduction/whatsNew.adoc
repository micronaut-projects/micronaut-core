Micronaut {version} includes the following changes:

=== Clients With No Base Path

For the situations when the host of a client call is variable, it is no longer required to pass a service id or URL to ann:http.client.annotation.Client[]. If no host is provided at the time of a request, a api:http.client.exceptions.NoHostException[] will be thrown.
