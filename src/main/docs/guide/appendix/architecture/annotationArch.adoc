Micronaut is an implementation of an annotation-based programming model. That is to say annotations form a fundamental part of the API design of the framework.

Given this design decision, a compilation-time model was formulated to address the challenges of evaluating annotations at runtime. 

The api:core.annotation.AnnotationMetadata[] API is a construct that is used both a compilation time and at runtime by framework components. `AnnotationMetadata` represents the computed fusion of annotation information for a particular type, field, constructor, method or bean property and may include both annotations declared in the source code, but also synthetic meta-annotations that can be used at runtime to implement framework logic.

When visiting source code within the <<compilerArch, Micronaut Compiler>> using the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/inject/ast/package-summary.html[Element API] for each api:inject.ast.ClassElement[], api:inject.ast.FieldElement[], api:inject.ast.MethodElement[], api:inject.ast.ConstructorElement[] and api:inject.ast.PropertyElement[] an instance of api:core.annotation.AnnotationMetadata[] is computed.

The `AnnotationMetadata` API tries to address the following challenges:

* Annotations can be inherited from types and interfaces into implementations. To avoid the need to traverse the class/interface hierarchy at runtime Micronaut will at build time compute inherited annotations and deal with member overriding rules
* Annotations can be annotated with other annotations. These annotations are often referred to as meta-annotations or stereotypes. The `AnnotationMetadata` API provides methods to understand whether a particular annotation is declared as meta-annotation and to find out what annotations are meta-annotated with other annotations
* It is often necessary to fuse annotation metadata together from different sources. For example, for JavaBean properties you want to combine the metadata from the private field, public getter and public setters into a single view otherwise you have to run logic to runtime to somehow combine this metadata from 3 distinct sources. 
* Repeatable annotations are combined and normalized. If inherited the annotations are combined from parent interfaces or classes providing a single API to evaluate repeatable annotations instead of requiring runtime logic to perform normalization.

When the source for a type is visited an instance of api:inject.ast.ClassElement[] is constructed via the api:inject.ast.ElementFactory[] API.

The api:inject.ast.ElementFactory[] uses an instance of api:inject.annotation.AbstractAnnotationMetadataBuilder[] which contains language specific implementations to construct `AnnotationMedata` for the underlying native type in the AST. In the case of Java this would be a `javax.model.element.TypeElement`.

The basic flow is visualized below:

Additionally, the api:inject.annotation.AbstractAnnotationMetadataBuilder[] will load via the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[standard Java service loader mechanism] one or more instances of the following types that allow manipulating how an annotation is represented in the `AnnotationMetadata`:

* api:inject.annotation.AnnotationMapper[] - A type that can map the value of one annotation to another, retaining the original annotation in the `AnnotationMetadata`
* api:inject.annotation.AnnotationTransformer[] - A type that can transform the value of one annotation to another, eliminating the original annotation from the `AnnotationMetadata`
* api:inject.annotation.AnnotationRemapper[] - A type that can transform the values of all annotations in a given package, eliminating the original annotations from the `AnnotationMetadata`

Note that at compilation time the api:core.annotation.AnnotationMetadata[] is mutable and can be further altered by implementations of api:inject.visitor.TypeElementVisitor[] by invoking the `annotate(..)` method of the api:inject.ast.Element[] API. However, at runtime the api:core.annotation.AnnotationMetadata[] is immutable and fixed. The purpose of this design to allow the compiler to be extended and for Micronaut to be able to interpret different source-level annotation-based programming models. 

In practice this effectively allows decoupling the source code level annotation model from what is used at runtime such that different annotations can be used to represent the same annotation.

For example `jakarata.inject.Inject` or Spring's `@Autowired` are supported as synonyms for `javax.inject.Inject` by transforming the source level annotation to `javax.inject.Inject` which is the only annotation represented at runtime.

Finally, annotations in Java also allow the definition of default values. These defaults are not retained in individual instances of `AnnotationMetadata` but instead stored in a shared, static application-wide map for later retrieval for annotations known to be used by the application.
