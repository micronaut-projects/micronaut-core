Micronaut is an implementation of the JSR-330 specification for Dependency Injection.

Dependency Injection (or Inversion of Control) is a widely adopted and common pattern in Java that allows loosely decoupling components to allow applications to be easily extended and tested. 

The way in which objects are wired together is decoupled from the objects themselves in this model by a separate programming model. In the case of Micronaut this model is based on annotations defined within the JSR-330 specification plus an extended set of annotations located within the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/context/annotation/package-summary.html[io.micronaut.context.annotation] package.

These annotations are visited by the <<compilerArch, Micronaut Compiler>> which traverses the source code language AST and builds a model used to wire objects together at runtime. 

NOTE: It is important to note that the actual object wiring is deferred until runtime.

For Java code api:annotation.processing.BeanDefinitionInjectProcessor[] (which is a Java Annotation https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.compiler/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html[Processor]) is invoked from the Java compiler for each class annotated with a bean definition annotation.

NOTE: What constitutes a bean defining annotation is complex as it takes into account meta-annotations, but in general it is any annotation annotated with a JSR-330 bean `@Scope`

The `BeanDefinitionInjectProcessor` will visit each bean in the user code source and generate additional byte code using the ASM byte code generation library that sits along side the annotated class in the same package.

NOTE: For historic reasons the dependency injection processor does not use the api:inject.visitor.TypeElementVisitor[] API but will likely do so in the future

Byte code generation is implemented in the api:inject.writer.BeanDefinitionWriter[] which contains methods to "visit" different aspects of the way is bean is defined (the api:inject.BeanDefinition[]).

The following diagram illustrates the flow:

image::arch/beanwriter.png[]

For example given the following type:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.inject.intro.Vehicle[tags="class",indent=0]

The following is generated:

* A `example.$Vehicle$Definition$Reference` class that implements the api:inject.BeanDefinitionReference[] interface that allows the application to soft load the bean definition without loading all of the metadata or the class itself (in the case where the introspected class is itself not on the classpath). Since references are loaded via link:{jdkapi}/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[ServiceLoader] an entry in a generated `META-INF/services/io.micronaut.inject.BeanDefinitionReference` referring to this type is also generated at compilation time.
* A `example.$Vehicle$Definition` which contains the actual api:inject.BeanDefinition[] information.

A api:inject.BeanDefinition[] is a type that holds metadata about the particular type including:

* Class level <<annotationArch, AnnotationMetadata>>
* The computed JSR-330 `@Scope` and `@Qualifier`
* Knowledge of the available api:inject.InjectionPoint[] instances
* References to any api:inject.ExecutableMethod[] defined

In addition the `BeanDefinition` contains logic which knows how the bean is wired together, including how the type is constructed and fields and/or methods injected.

During compilation the ASM byte code library is used to fill out the details of the `BeanDefinition`, including a `build` method that, for the previous example, looks like:

[source,java]
----
public Vehicle build(
    BeanResolutionContext resolution, // <1>
    BeanContext context, 
    BeanDefinition definition) {
    Vehicle bean = new Vehicle(
        (Engine) super.getBeanForConstructorArgument( // <2>
            resolution, 
            context, 
            0, // <3>
            (Qualifier)null)
    );
    return bean;
}
----

<1> The `BeanResolutionContext` is passed around to track circular bean references and improve error reporting. 
<2> The type is instantiated and each constructor argument looked up by calling methods of api:context.AbstractInitializableBeanDefinition[]
<3> In this case the index of the constructor argument is tracked

NOTE: Special handling is required when a Java field or method has `private` access. In this case Micronaut has no option but to fallback to using Java reflection to perform dependency injection. 

=== Configuration Properties Handling

The <<compilerArch, Micronaut Compiler>> handles beans declared with the meta-annotation ann:context.annotation.ConfigurationReader[] such as ann:context.annotation.ConfigurationProperties[] and ann:context.annotation.EachProperty[] distinctly to other beans.

In order to support binding <<config, Application Configuration>> to types annotated with one of the aforementioned annotations each discovered mutable bean property is dynamically annotated with the ann:context.annotation.Property[] annotation with the computed and normalized property name.

For example given the below type:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.config.properties.EngineConfig[tags="imports,class",indent=0,title="@ConfigurationProperties Example"]

The `setManufacturer(String)` method will be annotated with `@Property(name="my.engine.manufacturer")` the value of which will be resolved from the configured <<environments, Environment>>.

The `injectBean` method of api:context.AbstractInitializableBeanDefinition[] is subsequently overridden with logic to handle looking up the normalized property name `my.engine.manufacturer` from the current api:context.BeanContext[] and inject the value if it is present in a reflection-free manner.

NOTE: Property names are normalized into kebab case (lower case hyphen separated) which is the format used to store their values.

.Configuration Properties Injection
[source,java]
----
@Generated
protected Object injectBean(
    BeanResolutionContext resolution, 
    BeanContext context, 
    Object bean) {
    if (this.containsProperties(resolution, context)) { // <1>
        EngineConfig engineConfig = (EngineConfig) bean;
        if (this.containsPropertyValue(resolution, context, "my.engine.manufacturer")) { // <2>
            String value = (String) super.getPropertyValueForSetter( // <3>
                resolution, 
                context, 
                "setManufacturer", 
                Argument.of(String.class, "manufacturer"), // <4>
                "my.engine.manufacturer", // <5>
                (String)null // <6>
            )
            engineConfig.setManufacturer(value);
        }
    }
}
----

<1> A top level check to see if any properties exist with the prefix defined in the ann:context.annotation.ConfigurationProperties[] annotation is added.
<2> A check is performed to see if the property actually exists 
<3> If it does the value is looked up by calling the `getPropertyValueForSetter` method of api:context.AbstractInitializableBeanDefinition[] 
<4> An instance of api:core.type.Argument[] is created which is used for conversion to the target type (in this case `String`). The api:core.type.Argument[] may also contain generics information.
<5> The computed and normalized path to the property
<6> The default value if the api:core.bind.annotation.Bindable[] annotation is used to specify a default.
