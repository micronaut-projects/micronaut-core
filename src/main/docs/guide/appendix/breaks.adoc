This section will document breaking changes between Micronaut 2.x and Micronaut 3.x

=== Core Changes

==== Decapitalization Strategy

For many cases, one common one being introspections, getter names like `getXForwarded()` would result in the bean property being `XForwarded`. The name will now be `xForwarded`. This can affect many areas of the framework where names like `XForwarded` are used.

==== @Order default

Previously the default order value for the `@Order` annotation was the lowest precedence. It is now 0.

==== Deprecation Removal

Classes, constructors, etc that have been deprecated in previous versions of Micronaut have been removed.

==== Reflective Bean Map

In several places in Micronaut, it is required to get a map representation of your object. In previous versions, a reflection based strategy was used to retrieve that information if the class was not annotated with `@Introspected`. That functionality has been removed and it is now required to annotate classes with `@Introspected` that are being used in this way. Any class may be affected if it is passed as an argument or returned from any controller or client, among other use cases.

==== Implementations of `javax.inject.Provider` No Longer Generate Factories

In Micronaut 2.x if you defined a bean that implemented the `javax.inject.Provider` interface then the return type of the `get` method also automatically became a bean.

For example:

[source,java]
----
import javax.inject.Provider;
import javax.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
public class AProvider implements Provider<A> {
    @Override
    public A get() {
        return new AImpl();
    }
}
----

In the above example a bean of type `A` would automatically be exposed by Micronaut. This behaviour is no longer supported and instead the ann:context.annotation.Factory[] annotation should be used to express the same behaviour. For example:

[source,java]
----
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Factory;
import javax.inject.Provider;
import javax.inject.Singleton;

@Factory
public class AProvider implements Provider<A> {
    @Override
    @Singleton
    public A get() {
        return new AImpl();
    }
}
----
