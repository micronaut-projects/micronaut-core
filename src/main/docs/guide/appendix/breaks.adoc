This section documents breaking changes between Micronaut versions

== 4.0.0

=== Core Changes

==== Further Micronaut Modularization

The `micronaut-runtime` module has been split into separate modules depending on the application's use case:

===== Micronaut Discovery Core

`micronaut-discovery-core` - The base service discovery features are now a separate module. If your application listens for events such as api:discovery.event.ServiceReadyEvent[] or api:health.HeartBeatEvent[] this module should be added to the application classpath.

dependency::micronaut-discovery[]

===== Micronaut Retry

`micronaut-retry` - The retry implementation including annotations such as ann:retry.annotation.Retryable[] is now a separate module that can be optionally included in a Micronaut application.

In addition, since `micronaut-retry` is now optional declarative clients annotated with ann:http.client.annotation.Client[] no longer invoke fallbacks by default. To restore the previous behaviour add `micronaut-retry` to your classpath and annotate any declarative clients with ann:retry.annotation.Recoverable[].

To use the Retry functionality, add the following dependency:

dependency::micronaut-retry[]

==== Calling `registerSingleton(bean)` no longer overrides existing beans

If you call `registerSingleton(bean)` on the api:context.BeanContext[] it will no longer override existing beans if the type and qualifier match; instead, two beans will exist which may lead to a api:context.exceptions.NonUniqueBeanException[].

If you require replacing an existing bean you must formalize the replacement using the api:context.RuntimeBeanDefinition[] API, for example:

[source,java]
----
context.registerBeanDefinition(
    RuntimeBeanDefinition.builder(Codec.class, ()-> new OverridingCodec())
            .singleton(true)
            // the type of the bean to replace
            .replaces(ToBeReplacedCodec.class)
            .build()
);
----

==== WebSocket No Longer Required

`io.micronaut:micronaut-http-server` no longer exposes `micronaut-websocket` transitively. If you are using annotations such as ann:websocket.annotation.ServerWebSocket[], you should add the `micronaut-websocket` dependency to your application classpath:

dependency::micronaut-websocket[]

==== Reactor Instrumentation Moved to Reactor Module

The instrumentation features for Reactor have been moved to the `micronaut-reactor` module. If you require instrumentation of reactive code paths (for distributed tracing for example) you should make sure your application depends on `micronaut-reactor`:

dependency:micronaut-reactor[groupId="io.micronaut.reactor"]


==== Validation Support Moved to Validation Module

The validation features link:{micronautvalidationdocs}[have been moved to a separate module]. Moreover, the new validation module requires you to use `micronaut-validation-processor` in the annotation processor classpath.

dependency:micronaut-validation-processor[groupId="io.micronaut.validation",scope="annotationProcessor"]

dependency:micronaut-validation[groupId="io.micronaut.validation"]

==== Session Support Moved to Session Module

The Session handling features link:{micronautsessiondocs}[have been moved to their own module]. If you use the HTTP session module, change the maven coordinates from `io.micronaut:micronaut-session` to `io.micronaut.session:micronaut-session`.

dependency:micronaut-session[groupId="io.micronaut.session"]

==== Kotlin Flow Support Moved to Kotlin Module

Support for the Kotlin `Flow` type has been moved to the `micronaut-kotlin` module. If your application uses Kotlin `Flow` you should ensure the `micronaut-kotlin-runtime` module is on your application classpath:

dependency:micronaut-kotlin-runtime[groupId="io.micronaut.kotlin"]

==== Compilation Time API Split into new module

In order to keep the runtime small all types and interfaces that are used at compilation time only (like the `io.micronaut.inject.ast` API) have been moved into a separate module:

dependency:micronaut-core-processor[]

If you are using types and interfaces from this module you should take care to split the compilation time and runtime logic of your module into separate modules.

==== ASM No Longer Shaded

https://asm.ow2.io/[ASM] is no longer shaded into the `io.micronaut.asm` package. If you depend on this library you should directly depend on the latest version of ASM.

==== Caffeine No Longer Shaded

https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[Caffeine] is no longer shaded into the `io.micronaut.caffeine` package. If you depend on this library you should directly depend on the latest version of Caffeine.

==== Environment Deduction Disabled by Default

In previous versions of the Micronaut framework probes were used to attempt to deduce the running environment and establish whether the application was running in the Cloud. These probes involved network calls resulting in issues with startup performance and security concerns. These probes are disabled by default and can be re-enabled as necessary by calling `ApplicationContextBuilder.deduceCloudEnvironment(true)` if your application still requires this functionality.

==== Update to Groovy 4

Micronaut now uses Groovy 4.
This means that Groovy 4 is now the minimum version required to run Groovy Micronaut applications.
There have been several core differences in Groovy parsing and behavior for version 4 which can be found in the breaking changes section of the https://groovy-lang.org/releasenotes/groovy-4.0.html[4.0.0 release notes].

==== SnakeYAML no longer a direct dependency

SnakeYAML is no longer a direct dependency, if you need YAML configuration you should add SnakeYAML to your classpath explicitly

==== `javax.annotation` no longer a directory dependency

The `javax.annotation` library is no longer a directory dependency. Any references to types in the `javax.anotation` package should be changed to `jakarta.annotation`

==== Kotlin base version updated to 1.8.21

Kotlin has been updated to 1.8.21, which may cause issues when compiling or linking to Kotlin libraries.

==== Bean Introspection changes

Before, when both METHOD and FIELD were set as the access kind, the bean introspection would choose the same access type to get and set the property value. In Micronaut 4, the accessors can be of different kinds: a field to get and a method to set, and vice versa.

==== Annotations with retention CLASS are excluded at runtime

Annotations with the retention CLASS are not available in the annotation metadata at the runtime.

==== Interceptors with multiple interceptor bindings annotations

Interceptors with multiple interceptor binding annotations now require the same set of annotations to be present at the intercepted point. In the Micronaut 3 an interceptor with multiple binding annotations would need at least one of the binding annotations to be present at the intercepted point.

==== `ConversionService` and `ConversionService.SHARED` is no longer mutable

New type converters can be added to api:core.convert.MutableConversionService[] retrieved from the bean context or by declaring a bean of type api:core.convert.TypeConverter[].
To register a type converter into `ConversionService.SHARED`, the registration needs to be done via the service loader.

==== `ExceptionHandler` with POJO response type no longer results in an error response

Previously if you had an ExceptionHandler such as:

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class MyExceptionHandler implements ExceptionHandler<MyException, String> {

    @Override
    public String handle(HttpRequest request, MyException exception) {
        return "caught!";
    }
}
----

This would result in an internal server error response with `caught!` as the body.
This now returns an OK response.
If you want to return a POJO response as an error, you should use the `HttpResponse` type:

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class MyExceptionHandler implements ExceptionHandler<MyException, HttpResponse<String>> {

    @Override
    public HttpResponse<String> handle(HttpRequest request, MyException exception) {
        return HttpResponse.badRequest("caught!");
    }
}
----

==== `HttpContentProcessor` superseded by `MessageBodyHandler` API

The netty-specific `HttpContentProcessor` API has been replaced by a new, experimental `MessageBodyHandler` API that
does not rely on netty and is more powerful. There is no compatibility layer, so the old `HttpContentProcessor` will stop
working and need to be rewritten.

==== `@Body` annotation on controller parameters

Before 4.0, the binding logic for controller parameters was more lax. A bare parameter, e.g. `void test(String title)`,
could either match a part of the request body (`foo` if the request body is `{"title":"foo"}`), come from a query
parameter, or could bind to the full request body (`{"x":"y"}` if the request body is `{"x":"y"}`).

Binding from the full body to these bare parameters is no longer supported. If you wish to bind the full body, the
parameter _must_ be annotated with `@Body`.

Additionally, it is no longer permitted to mix body component binding with full body binding. For example,
`void test(@Body Bean bean, String title)` will not work anymore if `title`  needs to come from the
body that is already bound to `bean`.

These changes also apply to functions that are exposed using `micronaut-function-web`.

==== Delayed body access

When accessing the request body in two places, for example once as a normal controller `@Body` parameter and then in an
error handler, Micronaut HTTP is now stricter about allowed types. If in doubt, for the second body access, call
`HttpRequest.getBody()` and you will get the same body type the first access requested.

==== `text/plain` messages are more restrictive about allowed types

For `text/plain` request and response body reading and writing, in 3.x any type was allowed. For writing, the object
was converted using `toString`, and for reading, the object was converted using `ConversionService`. For
example, if you have a controller that returns an `Instant` as `text/plain`, it would write it using `toString` like
`2023-05-25T13:25:02.925Z`. In the other direction, if you have a controller with a `@Body Instant instant`
parameter, the same text would be converted to `Instant` using `ConversionService`.

This is not permitted anymore for 4.x, except for some restricted types. The recommended fix is to move to
`application/json` as the content type. `toString` is not a stable serialization format, JSON is more reliable.

Alternatively, you can set the `micronaut.http.legacy-text-conversion` configuration option to `true` to restore the
old behavior.

==== `OncePerRequestHttpServerFilter` removed

Since Micronaut 3.0 the `OncePerRequestHttpServerFilter` class was deprecated and marked for removal. This class is now removed. Implement link:{api}/io/micronaut/http/filter/HttpServerFilter.html[HttpServerFilter] instead, and replace any usages of `micronaut.once` attributes with a custom attribute name.

==== CORS support with the `@CrossOrigin` annotation

In previous and current versions of Micronaut Framework, configuration-based CORS defaults to allow all origins when CORS is enabled and `allowed-origins` is not set otherwise. However, in previous versions of Micronaut Framework using the `@CrossOrigin` annotation defaults to no origins allowed, requiring the `allowedOrigins` attribute to be set. In Micronaut 4, `@CrossOrigin` is changed to match the behavior of configuration-based CORS. In other words, enabling CORS with `@CrossOrigin` without specifying any attributes means all origins are allowed.
