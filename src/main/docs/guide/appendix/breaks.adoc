This section will document breaking changes that may happen during milestone or release candidate releases, as well as major releases eg (1.x.x -> 2.x.x).

==== 1.2.0

The following changes could potentially be considered to be breaking changes, however the likelihood of any negative impact is low.

* The AWS distributed configuration through systems manager property store supported the notion of `key=value` in the value section of the configuration. This functionality has been removed because it did not consider properties that contain an `=` but are not in the format of `key=value`.



==== 1.1.0

The following changes could potentially be considered to be breaking changes, however the likelihood of any negative impact is low.

* link:{api}/io/micronaut/session/http/HttpSessionConfiguration.html[HttpSessionConfiguration] default value for `cookiePath` is `/`. The change was necessary for cookies to function normally.

* The link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/render/AccessRefreshToken.html[AccessRefreshToken] API has been changed to  include `tokenType` and `expiresIn`. This change was necessary to comply with the token response link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.4.html[RFC 6749].

* Route binding behavior for a request argument with a generic type has changed. For routes that take in an `HttpRequest<SomeType>`, an `UnsatisfiedRouteException` will be thrown if no body is found in the request. To restore the previous behavior, remove the generic type from the argument.
+
    public String hello(HttpRequest<Author> request) //requires the body to be present

    public String hello(HttpRequest request) //the body will not be read (same as 1.0.x)
+


==== 1.0.0.RC3

* All Micronaut modules have been renamed to include `micronaut-` prefix to make it easier to manage dependencies. If you are upgrading rename all references modules. Example `bom` -> `micronaut-bom`, `inject` -> `micronaut-inject` etc.
* Methods for JWT signature generation have been removed from link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/rsa/RSASignatureConfiguration.html[RSASignatureConfiguration] or
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/ec/ECSignatureConfiguration.html[ECSignatureConfiguration]. Those beans should be used in microservices where you need only signature verification and not generation.

To enable a RSA or EC JWT signature generation, you need to have in your app a bean of type link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/rsa/RSASignatureGeneratorConfiguration.html[RSASignatureGeneratorConfiguration] or
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/ec/ECSignatureGeneratorConfiguration.html[ECSignatureGeneratorConfiguration].


==== 1.0.0.RC2

* `io.micronaut.security.authentication.Authenticator::authenticate` method signature has changed from:

`public Publisher<AuthenticationResponse> authenticate(UsernamePasswordCredentials credentials)`

to:

`public Publisher<AuthenticationResponse> authenticate(AuthenticationRequest authenticationRequest)`

==== 1.0.0.RC1

* The default port if no port is specified is now port 8080 instead of a random port, except in the test environment. A random port can be obtained by setting the port to -1.
* The configuration for static resource has been changed to allow multiple mappings, each with their own set of paths. This will allow accessing resources at multiple URLs. Previously the configuration might have looked like:
+
  micronaut:
      router:
          static:
              resources:
                  enabled: true
                  mapping: /static/**
                  paths:
                    - classpath:static
+
And now the equivalent configuration would be:
+
  micronaut:
      router:
          static-resources:
              default:
                  enabled: true
                  mapping: /static/**
                  paths:
                    - classpath:static
+
The word `default` in that example is arbitrary and can be replaced with any name that is appropriate to describe the category of resources that will be served.
+
NOTE: Notice the change from `static.resources` to `static-resources`.
+
* The CLI feature for Netflix Archaius was incorrectly named `netflix-archius`. The feature has now been renamed to reflect the correct name, `netflix-archaius`.
* The intercept url map security rule now no longer considers the query part of the request when determining if the request matches. Previously `/?value=true` would *not* match `/`.
* Several APIs surrounding route URI matching and template parsing have changed to allow more information to be retrieved from the parsing process.
* The following packages have been renamed:

 io.micronaut.http.server.binding -> io.micronaut.http.bind

* The following annotations have been moved to new locations:

 io.micronaut.http.client.Client -> io.micronaut.http.client.annotation.Client
 io.micronaut.security.Secured -> io.micronaut.security.annotation.Secured

* The jackson deserialization features ACCEPT_SINGLE_VALUE_AS_ARRAY and UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS are now enabled by default. To revert to the previous behavior, see the section on <<_jackson_configuration, Jackson Configuration>> for information on how to customize deserialization features.


==== 1.0.0.M4

* Libraries compiled against earlier versions of Micronaut are not binary compatible with this release.
* The Java module names generated in previous versions were invalid because they contained a `-`. Module names with dashes were converted to an underscore. For example: `io.micronaut.inject-java` -> `io.micronaut.inject_java`.
* The annotation metadata API has been changed to no longer use reflective proxies for annotations. The methods that used to return the proxies now return an `AnnotationValue` that contains all of the data that existed in the proxy. The methods to create the proxies now exist under `synthesize..`.
* Many classes no longer implement `AnnotatedElement`.
* `AnnotationUtil` has seen significant changes and is now marked as an internal class.
* `BeanContext.getBeanRegistrations` has been renamed to `BeanContext.getActiveBeanRegistrations`.
* Endpoint annotations have moved packages: `io.micronaut.management.endpoint` -> `io.micronaut.management.endpoint.annotation`.
* Endpoint method arguments were previously included in the route URI by default. Now endpoint arguments are *not* included in the route URI by default. An annotation, `@Selector` has been added to indicate an endpoint argument *should* be included in the URI.
* The `@Controller` annotation now requires a value. Previously a convention was used to determine the URI.
* The `HttpMethodMapping` annotations (`@Get`, `@Put`, etc) have changed their default behavior. They no longer use a convention based off the method name if the URI was not provided. The URI is still not required, however it now defaults to `/`. The new default means the method will be accessible from the controller URI.

==== 1.0.0.M3

* The contract for `io.micronaut.http.codec.MediaTypeCodec` has changed to support multiple media types.
* To reduce confusion around `@Parameter`, it can no longer be used to denote an argument should be bound from the request url. Its sole purpose is defining arguments for parameterized beans. Use `@QueryValue` instead.
* The health endpoint will now only report details when the user is authenticated. To revert to the previous behavior, set `endpoints.health.detailsVisible: ANONYMOUS`.
* The CLI options have been standardized to use two leading dashes for long options (like `--stacktrace`) and one for shortcuts (like `-h`). That means that some options no longer work. For example, this command used to work with M2: `create-app -lang groovy myapp`. From M3, you will see this error: `Could not convert 'ang' to SupportedLanguage for option '--lang'`. Specifying either `-l LANG` or `--lang LANG` works as expected.
* The following packages have been renamed:
 - `io.micronaut.configurations.ribbon` -> `io.micronaut.configuration.ribbon`
 - `io.micronaut.configurations.hystrix` -> `io.micronaut.configuration.hystrix`
 - `io.micronaut.configurations.aws` -> `io.micronaut.configuration.aws`
 - `io.micronaut.http.netty.buffer` -> `io.micronaut.buffer.netty`
* The default Consul configuration prefix has been changed to reflect changes in the latest version of Consul. Previously a leading slash was expected and the default value was `/config/`. The new default value is `config/`. To restore the previous behavior, set `consul.client.config.path = /config/`
* The `session` module will now serialize POJOs to JSON using Jackson by default instead of Java Serialization. This change is because Java serialization will be removed and deprecated in a future version of the JDK.


==== 1.0.0.M2

* The constructor signature for DefaultHttpClient has changed to include an extra argument. This change should not impact existing uses.
* Libraries compiled against M1 are not binary compatible with M2.
* For Java 9+ automatic module name has been set to `<groupId>.<name>`. Previously if you have been using the "inject-java" module, the module is now named "io.micronaut.inject-java".
* When an HttpClientResponseException is thrown, the body of the response will be set to the exception message for responses with a text media type. Previously the status description was returned.
* Mongo configurations were updated to a new version of the driver (3.6.1 -> 3.7.1), which may break existing uses. See their link:http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.7/upgrading/[upgrading] page for more information.
* The `router` configuration key was changed to be `micronaut.router`. Static resource configuration is affected by this change. Please update your configuration: `router.static.resources` -> `micronaut.router.static.resources`.
