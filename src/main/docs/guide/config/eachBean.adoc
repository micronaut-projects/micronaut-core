The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/EachProperty.html[@EachProperty] is a great way to drive dynamic configuration, but typically you want to inject that configuration into another bean that depends on it. Injecting a single instance with a hard coded qualifier is not a great solution, hence `@EachProperty` is typically used in combination with link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/EachBean.html[@EachBean]:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.config.env.DataSourceFactory[tags="eachBean", indent=0, title="Using @EachBean"]

<1> The above example defines a bean link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Factory.html[Factory] that will create instances of `javax.sql.DataSource`.
<2> The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/EachBean.html[@EachBean] annotation is used to indicate that a new `DataSource` bean should be created for each `DataSourceConfiguration` defined in the previous section.
<3> The `DataSourceConfiguration` instance is injected as a method argument and used to drive the configuration of each `javax.sql.DataSource`

Note that `@EachBean` requires that the parent bean has a `@Named` qualifier, since the qualifier is inherited by each bean created by `@EachBean`.

In other words, to retrieve the `DataSource` created by `test.datasource.one` you can do:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.config.env.EachBeanTest[tags="beans", indent=0, title="Using a Qualifier"]

<1> We demonstrate here that there are indeed two data sources. How can we get one in particular?
<2> By using `Qualifiers.byName("one")`, we can select which of the two beans we'd like to reference.
