Since 4.0, Micronaut framework supports embedding evaluated expressions in annotation values using `#{...}` syntax which
allows to achieve even more flexibility while configuring your application.

.Evaluated Expression example
[source,groovy]
----
@Value("#{ T(Math).random() }")
double injectedValue;
----

Expressions can be defined whenever an annotation member accepts a string or an array of strings.

NOTE: Expressions are currently not supported for "type use" annotations (annotations that declare `ElementType.TYPE_USE`).

.Evaluated Expression in array
[source,java]
----
@Singleton
@Requires(env = {"dev", "#{ 'test' }"})
public class EvaluatedExpressionInArray {}
----

You can also embed one or more expressions in a string template in a similar manner to embedding properties with the `${...}` syntax.

.Evaluated Expression template
[source,groovy]
----
@Value("http://#{'hostname'}/#{'path'}")
String url;
----

Evaluated Expressions are validated and compiled at build time which guarantees type safety at runtime.

Once an application is running expressions are evaluated on demand as part of annotation metadata resolution. The
usage of expressions does not impact performance as evaluation process is completely reflection free.

Note that, for security reasons expressions cannot be dynamically compiled at runtime from potentially untrusted
input. All expressions are compiled and checked statically during the compilation process of the application with
errors reported as compilation failures.

In general, expressions can be treated as statement written using a programming language with reduced
set of available features. Even though the complexity of expression is only limited by the list of supported syntax
constructs, it is in general not recommended to place complex logic inside an expression as there are usually better
ways to achieve the same result.

== Using Expressions in Micronaut framework

Expressions can be used anywhere throughout the Micronaut framework and associated modules, but as an example, you can use them to implement simple scheduled job control, for example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.expressions.ExampleJob[tags="imports,clazz",title="Job Control with Expressions"]

<1> Here the `condition` member of the ann:scheduling.annotation.Scheduled[] annotation is used to only execute the job if a pre-condition is met.
<2> The `condition` invokes a method of the type that checks if the job is paused. Other methods can be used to pause and resume execution of the job as desired.

TIP: You can also use expressions to perform conditional routing using the ann:http.annotation.RouteCondition[] annotation.

== Evaluated Expression Language Reference

The Evaluated Expressions syntax supports the following functionality:

* Literal Values
* Math Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Ternary Operator
* Type References
* Method Invocation
* Property Access
* Retrieving Beans from Bean Context
* Retrieving Environment Properties

=== Literal Values

The following types of literal values are supported:

* `null`
* boolean values (`true`, `false`)
* strings, which need to be surrounded with single quotation mark (`'`)
* numeric values (`int`, `long`, `float`, `double`)

Integer and Long values can also be specified in hexadecimal or octal notation. Float and Double values can also be
specified in exponential notation. All numeric values can be negative as well.

.Literal values examples
[source]
----
#{ null }
#{ true }
#{ 'string value' }
#{ 10 }
#{ 0xFFL }
#{ 10L }
#{ .123f }
#{ 1E+1d }
#{ 123D }
----

=== Math Operators

The supported mathematical operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`. Math operators can only be applied to numeric
values (except `+` which can be used for string concatenation as well). Mathematical operations are performed in order
enforced by standard operator precedence. You can also change evaluation order by using brackets `()`.

`/` and `%` operators can be aliased by `div` and `mod` keywords respectively.

.Math operators examples
[source]
----
#{ 1 + 2 }             // 3
#{ 'a' + 'b' + 'c' }   // 'abc'
#{ 7 - 3 }             // 4
#{ 7 * 3 }             // 21
#{ 7 * ( 3 + 1) }      // 28

#{ 15 / 3 }            // 5
#{ 15 div 3 }          // 5

#{ 15 % 3 }            // 0
#{ 15 mod 3 }          // 0

// Unlike in Java, ^ operator means exponentiation
#{ 3 ^ 2 }             // 9
----

=== Comparison Operators

The following comparison operators are supported: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `\<=`, `matches`
Comparison operations are performed in order enforced by standard operator precedence.
You can also change evaluation order by using brackets `()`.

Equality check is supported for both primitive types and objects. It is performed using `Object.equals()` method.

`>`, `<`, `>=`, `\<=` operations can be applied to numeric types or types that implement `java.lang.Comparable`
interface.

`matches` keyword can be used to determine whether a string matches provided regular expression which has to
be specified as string literal. The regular expression itself will be checked for validity at compilation time.

.Comparison operators examples
[source]
----
#{ 1 + 2 == 3 }         // true
#{ 'abc' != 'abc' }     // false
#{ 7 > 3 }              // true
#{ 7 < 3 }              // false
#{ 7 >= 7 }             // true
#{ 7 <= 8 }             // false

#{ 'AbC' matches '[A-Za-z*'  }      // Compilation failure
#{ 'AbC' matches '[A-Za-z]*'  }     // true
#{ 'AbC' matches '[a-z]*'  }        // false
----

=== Logical Operators

The following logical operators are supported:

* `&&` (can be aliased with `and`)
* `||` (can be aliased with `or`),
* `!` (can be aliaded with `not`)
* `empty` / `not empty` (works with strings, collections, arrays, and maps)

Logical operations are performed in order enforced by standard operator precedence.
You can also change evaluation order by using brackets `()`.

.Logical operators examples
[source]
----
#{ true && false }         // false
#{ true and true }         // true

#{ true || false }         // true
#{ false or false }        // false

#{ !false }                // true
#{ !!true }                // true

#{ empty '' }              // true
#{ not empty '' }          // false
----

=== Ternary Operator

A standard ternary operator is supported to allow specifying if-then-else conditional logic in expression

[source]
----
condition ? thenBranch : elseBranch
----

where `condition` evaluation should provide boolean value, and the complexity of `then` and `else` branches is not
limited.

.Ternary operator examples
[source]
----
#{ 15 > 10 ? 'a' : 'b' }    // 'a'
#{ 15 >= 16 ? 'a' : 'b' }   // 'b'
----

=== Dot and Safe Navigation Operator

The dot operator can be used to access methods and properties of a value within an expression. For example:

.Dot operator usage
[source]
----
#{ collection.size() > 0 }
#{ foo.bar.name == "Fred" }
----

You can also use the safe dereference operator `?.` to navigate paths in a null safe way:

.Safe dereference operator
[source]
----
#{ foo?.bar?.name == "Fred" }
----

TIP: When used, the safe dereference operator will also automatically unwrap Java's `Optional` type.

=== Type References

A predefined syntax construct `T(...)` can be used to reference a class. The value inside brackets should be fully
qualified class name (including the package name). The only exception is `java.lang.*` classes which can be referenced
directly by only specifying the simple class name. Primitive types can not be referenced.

Type References are evaluated in different ways depending on the context.

==== Simple type reference

A simple type reference is resolved as a `Class<?>` object.

.Type reference example
[source]
----
#{ T(java.lang.String) }    // String.class
----

Same rule applies if type reference is specified as a method argument.

==== Type check with `instanceof`

A Type Reference can be used as the right-hand side part of the `instanceof` operator

.Type check example
[source]
----
#{ 'abc' instanceof T(String) }  // true
----

which is equivalent to the following Java code and will be evaluated as a boolean value:

[source]
----
"abc" instanceof String
----

==== Static method invocation

Type Reference can be used to invoke a static method of a class

.Static method invocation
[source]
----
#{ T(Math).random() }
----

=== Expression Evaluation Context

By default, the only methods you can invoke inside Evaluated Expressions are static methods using type references.

The available methods can be extended by extended the evaluation context. There are two ways to extend the evaluation context. The first involves registering new context class via a custom api:TypeElementVisitor[].

NOTE: The api:TypeElementVisitor[] has to be on the annotation processor classpath, therefore needs to be defined in a separate module that can be included on this classpath.

Once a class is registered within evaluation context the methods and properties of the class are available for referencing in evaluated expressions.

Consider the following example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.expressions.CustomEvaluationContext[title="User-defined evaluated expression context"]

NOTE: The class should be resolvable as a bean can use `jakarta.inject` annotations to inject other types if necessary. In addition, for performance reasons all evaluation context classes are effectively singleton regardless of the defined scope.

Registering this class can be achieved with a custom implementation of api:expressions.context.ExpressionEvaluationContextRegistrar[] that is registered via service loader as a api:inject.visitor.TypeElementVisitor[] (create a new `META-INF/services/io.micronaut.inject.visitor.TypeElementVisitor` file referencing the new class) and placed on the annotation processor classpath:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.expressions.ContextRegistrar[title="Defining a ExpressionEvaluationContextRegistrar"]

Method `generateRandom(int, int)` can now be used within Evaluated Expression in the following way:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.expressions.ContextConsumer[title="Usage of user-defined evaluated expression context"]

At runtime, the bean will be retrieved from
application context and respective method will be invoked.

If a matching method is not found within evaluation context at compilation time, the compilation will fail. A
compilation error will also occur if multiple suitable methods are found in the evaluation context, keep that in mind
if you provide multiple api:expressions.context.ExpressionEvaluationContextRegistrar[] that a conflict can occur as these types are effectively global.

The methods will be considered ambiguous (leading to compilation failure) when their names are the same and list of
provided arguments matches multiple methods parameters.

Using a api:expressions.context.ExpressionEvaluationContextRegistrar[] makes its methods and properties available for evaluated
expressions within any annotation in a global manner.

However, you can also specify evaluation context scoped to concrete annotation or
annotation member using ann:context.annotation.AnnotationExpressionContext[].

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.expressions.AnnotationContextExample[title="Usage of annotation level evaluated expression context"]

<1> Here two new methods are introduced to the context called `firstValue()` and `secondValue()` only for the scope of the `@CustomAnnotation`
<2> The `firstValue()` method is defined in a bean called `AnnotationContext`
<3> The `secondValue()` method is defined in a bean called `AnnotationMemberContext`
<4> On the `@CustomAnnotation` annotation the methods of the `AnnotationContext` type are exposed to all members of the annotation (type level context).
<5> On the `value()` member of the `@CustomAnnotation` annotation the methods of the `AnnotationContextExample` are made available but scoped only to the `value()` member.

Again context classes need to be explicitly defined as beans to make them available for retrieval from
application context at runtime.

=== Method Invocation

You can invoke both static methods using type references, methods from evaluation context and methods on objects,
which means method chaining is supported.

.Chaining methods in expression
[source,java]
----
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Value;
import jakarta.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
class CustomEvaluationContext {

    public String stringValue() {
        return "stringValue";
    }

}

@Singleton
class ContextConsumer {

    @Value("#{ #stringValue().length() }")
    public int stringLength;

}
----

Varargs methods invocation is supported as well. Note that if last parameter of a method is an array, you can still
invoke it providing list of arguments separated by comma without explicitly wrapping it into array. So in this case
it will be treated in same way as if last method argument was explicitly specified as varargs parameter.

.Invoking varargs methods in expressions
[source,java]
----
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Value;
import jakarta.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
class CustomEvaluationContext {

    public int countIntegers(int... values) {
        return values.length;
    }

    public int countStrings(String[] values) {
        return values.length;
    }

}

@Singleton
class ContextConsumer {

    @Value("#{ #countIntegers(1, 2, 3) }")
    public int totalIntegers;

    @Value("#{ #countStrings('a', 'b', 'c') }")
    public int totalStrings;

}
----

=== Property Access

JavaBean properties can be accessed simply be referencing their names from evaluation context prefixed with `#`. Bean
properties can also be chained with dot in the same way as methods.

.Accessing bean properties in expressions
[source,java]
----

import io.micronaut.context.annotation.Value;
import jakarta.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
class CustomEvaluationContext {

    public String getName() {
        return "Bob";
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return 25;
    }

}

@Singleton
class ContextConsumer {

    @Value("#{ 'Name is ' + #name + ', age is ' + #age }")
    public String value;

}
----

=== Retrieving Beans from Bean Context

A predefined syntax construct `ctx[...]` can be used to retrieve beans from bean
context. The argument inside square brackets has to be a fully qualified class name (note that `T(...)` wrapper is
optional and can be omitted for simplicity).

.Retrieving beans from bean context
[source]
----
#{ ctx[T(io.micronaut.example.ContextBean)] }
#{ ctx[io.micronaut.example.ContextBean] }
----

=== Retrieving Environment Properties

A syntax construct `env[...]` can be used to retrieve environment properties by name.
The expression inside square brackets has to resolve to string value, otherwise compilation will fail. If property
value will be absent at runtime, the expression will return `null`

.Retrieving Environment Properties
[source]
----
#{ env['test.property'] }
----
