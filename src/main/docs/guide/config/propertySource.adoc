Additional api:io.micronaut.context.env.PropertySource[] instances can be added to the environment prior to initializing the api:context.ApplicationContext[].

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.env.EnvironmentSpec[tags="envProps",indent=0,title="Initializing the Environment"]

The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/PropertySource.html[PropertySource.of] method can be used to create a `PropertySource` from a map of values.

Alternatively one can register a link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/PropertySourceLoader.html[PropertySourceLoader] by creating a `META-INF/services/io.micronaut.context.env.PropertySourceLoader` file containing a reference to the class name of the `PropertySourceLoader`.

=== Included PropertySource Loaders

Micronaut by default contains `PropertySourceLoader` implementations that load properties from the given locations and priority:

. Command line arguments
. Properties from `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` (for Spring compatibility)
. Properties from `MICRONAUT_APPLICATION_JSON`
. Java System Properties
. OS environment variables
. Configuration files loaded in order from the system property 'micronaut.config.files' or the environment variable `MICRONAUT_CONFIG_FILES`. The value can be a comma-separated list of paths with the last file having precedence. The files can be referenced from the file system as a path, or the classpath with a `classpath:` prefix.
. Environment-specific properties from `application-{environment}.{extension}`
. Application-specific properties from `application.{extension}`

TIP: `.properties`, `.json`, `.yml` are supported out of the box. For Groovy users `.groovy` is supported as well.

=== Supplying Configuration via Command Line

Configuration can be supplied at the command line using Gradle or our Maven plugin. For example:

[source,bash]
.Gradle
----
$ ./gradlew run --args="-endpoints.health.enabled=true -config.property=test"
----

[source,bash]
.Maven
----
$ ./mvnw mn:run -Dmn.appArgs="-endpoints.health.enabled=true -config.property=test"
----

For the configuration to be a part of the context, the args from the main method must be passed to the context builder. For example:

[source,java]
----
import io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut;

public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Micronaut.run(Application.class, args); // passing args
    }
}
----

=== Property Value Placeholders

Micronaut includes a property placeholder syntax to reference configuration properties both within configuration values and with any Micronaut annotation. See ann:io.micronaut.context.annotation.Value[] and the section on <<valueAnnotation,Configuration Injection>>.

TIP: Programmatic usage is also possible via the api:io.micronaut.context.env.PropertyPlaceholderResolver[] interface.

The basic syntax is to wrap a reference to a property in `${...}`. For example in `application.yml`:

.Defining Property Placeholders
[source,yaml]
----
myapp:
  endpoint: http://${micronaut.server.host}:${micronaut.server.port}/foo
----

The above example embeds references to the `micronaut.server.host` and `micronaut.server.port` properties.

You can specify default values by defining a value after the `:` character. For example:

.Using Default Values
[source,yaml]
----
myapp:
  endpoint: http://${micronaut.server.host:localhost}:${micronaut.server.port:8080}/foo
----

The above example defaults to `localhost` and port `8080` if no value is found (rather than throwing an exception). Note that if the default value contains a `:` character, you must escape it using backticks:

.Using Backticks
[source,yaml]
----
myapp:
  endpoint: ${server.address:`http://localhost:8080`}/foo
----

The above example looks for a `server.address` property and defaults to `http://localhost:8080`. This default value is escaped with backticks since it has a `:` character.

=== Property Value Binding

Note that these property references should be in kebab case (lowercase and hyphen-separated) when placing references in code or in placeholder values. For example, use `micronaut.server.default-charset` and not `micronaut.server.defaultCharset`.

Micronaut still allows specifying the latter in configuration, but normalizes the properties into kebab case form to optimize memory consumption and reduce complexity when resolving properties. The following table summarizes how properties are normalized from different sources:

.Property Value Normalization
|===
|Configuration Value |Resulting Properties|Property Source

|`myApp.myStuff` | `my-app.my-stuff` | Properties, YAML etc.

|`my-app.myStuff` | `my-app.my-stuff` | Properties, YAML etc.
|`myApp.my-stuff` | `my-app.my-stuff` | Properties, YAML etc.

|`MYAPP_MYSTUFF` | `myapp.mystuff`, `myapp-mystuff` | Environment Variable

|`MY_APP_MY_STUFF` | `my.app.my.stuff`, `my.app.my-stuff`, `my.app-my.stuff`, `my.app-my-stuff`, `my-app.my.stuff`, `my-app.my-stuff`, `my-app-my.stuff`, `my-app-my-stuff`  | Environment Variable
|===

Environment variables are treated specially to allow more flexibility. Note that there is no way to reference an environment variable with camel-case.

IMPORTANT: Because the number of properties generated is exponential based on the number of `_` characters in an environment variable, it is recommended to refine which, if any, environment variables are included in configuration if the number of environment variables with multiple underscores is high.

To control how environment properties participate in configuration, call the respective methods on the `Micronaut` builder.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.Application[tags="imports,class",title="Application class"]

NOTE: The configuration above does not have any impact on property placeholders. It is still possible to reference an environment variable in a placeholder regardless of whether environment configuration is disabled, or even if the specific property is explicitly excluded.

=== Using Random Properties

You can use `random` values by using the following properties. These can be used in configuration files as variables like the following.

[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  application:
    name: myapplication
    instance:
      id: ${random.shortuuid}
----

.Random Values
|===
|Property |Value

|random.port
|An available random port number

|random.int
|Random int

|random.integer
|Random int

|random.long
|Random long

|random.float
|Random float

|random.shortuuid
|Random UUID of only 10 chars in length (Note: As this isn't full UUID, collision COULD occur)

|random.uuid
|Random UUID with dashes

|random.uuid2
|Random UUID without dashes
|===

=== Fail Fast Property Injection

For beans that inject required properties, the injection and potential failure will not occur until the bean is requested. To verify at startup that the properties exist and can be injected, the bean can be annotated with ann:io.micronaut.context.annotation.Context[]. Context-scoped beans are injected at startup, and startup fails if any required properties are missing or cannot be converted to the required type.

IMPORTANT: It is recommended to use this feature sparingly to ensure fast startup.

=== Controlling Log Levels with Properties

Log levels can be configured via properties defined in `application.yml` (and environment variables) with the `log.level` prefix:

[source,yaml]
----
logger:
  levels:
    foo.bar: ERROR
----

The same configuration can be achieved by setting the environment variable `LOGGER_LEVELS_FOO_BAR`. Note that there is currently no way to set log levels for unconventional prefixes such as `foo.barBaz`.

Note that the ability to control log levels via config is controlled via the api:logging.LoggingSystem[] interface. Currently, Micronaut includes a single implementation that allows setting log levels for the Logback library. If you use another library, you should provide a bean that implements this interface.
