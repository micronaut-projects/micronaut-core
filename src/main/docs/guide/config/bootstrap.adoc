Most application configuration is stored in `application.yml`, environment-specific files like `application-{environment}.{extension}`, environment and system properties, etc.
These configure the application context.
But during application startup, before the application context is created, a "bootstrap" context can be created to store configuration necessary to retrieve additional configuration for the main context. Typically that additional configuration is in some remote source.

The bootstrap context is enabled if one of the following conditions are met:

- `src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml` is present
- `src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties` is present
- The link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/Environment.html#BOOTSTRAP_CONTEXT_PROPERTY[micronaut.bootstrap.context^] system property is set to true

NOTE: The `boostrap.yml` and `bootstrap.properties` files need only to exist. No configuration is required to be contained within them.

Configuration properties that must be present before application context configuration properties are resolved, for example when using distributed configuration, are stored in a bootstrap configuration file. Once it is determined the bootstrap context is enabled (as described above), the bootstrap configuration files are read using the same rules as regular application configuration.
See the <<propertySource, property source>> documentation for the details. The only difference is the prefix (`bootstrap` instead of `application`).

The file name prefix `bootstrap` is configurable with a system property link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/env/Environment.html#BOOTSTRAP_NAME_PROPERTY[micronaut.bootstrap.name^].

NOTE: Any configuration in the bootstrap context is not necessary to be duplicated in the main context. The bootstrap context configuration is carried over to the main context automatically. That means if a configuration property is needed in both places, it should go into the bootstrap context configuration.

See the <<distributedConfiguration, distributed configuration>> section of the documentation for the list of integrations with common distributed configuration solutions.
