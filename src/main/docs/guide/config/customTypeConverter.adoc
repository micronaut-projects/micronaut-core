Micronaut features a built in type conversion mechanism that is extensible. To add additional type converters you register beans of type api:core.convert.TypeConverter[].

The following example shows how to use one of the built-in converters (Map to an Object) or create your own.

Consider the following api:context.annotation.ConfigurationProperties[]:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.config.converters.MyConfigurationProperties[tags="class", indent=0]

The type `MyConfigurationProperties` features a property called `updatedAt` which is of type jdk:java.time.LocalDate[].

Now let's say you want to allow binding to this property from a map via configuration:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.config.converters.MyConfigurationPropertiesSpec[tags="runContext", indent=0]

<1> Note how we match the `myapp` prefix and `updatedAt` property name in our `MyConfigurationProperties` class above

This won't work by default, since there is no built in conversion from `Map` to `LocalDate`. To resolve this you can define a custom api:core.convert.TypeConverter[]:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.config.converters.MapToLocalDateConverter[tags="imports,class", indent=0]

<1> The class implements api:core.convert.TypeConverter[] which takes two generic arguments. The type you are converting from and the type you are converting to
<2> The implementation delegate to the default shared conversion service to convert the parts of the map that make the day, month and year into a `LocalDate`
<3> If an exception occurs you can call `reject(..)` which propagates additional information to the container if something goes wrong during binding
