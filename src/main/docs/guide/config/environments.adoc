The application environment is modelled by the api:context.env.Environment interface, which allows specifying one or many unique environment names when creating an api:context.ApplicationContext[].

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.env.EnvironmentSpec[tags="env",indent=0,title="Initializing the Environment"]

The active environment names serve the purpose of allowing loading different configuration files depending on the environment and also using the ann:.context.annotation.Requires[] annotation to conditionally load beans or bean ann:.context.annotation.Configuration[] packages.

In addition, Micronaut will attempt to detect the current environments. For example within a Spock or JUnit test the api:context.env.Environment#TEST[] environment will be automatically active.

Additional active environments can be specified using the `micronaut.environments` system property or the `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS` environment variable. These can be specified as a comma separated list. For example:

.Specifying environments
[source,bash]
----
$ java -Dmicronaut.environments=foo,bar -jar myapp.jar
----

The above activates environments called `foo` and `bar`.

Finally, the Cloud environment names are also detected. See the section on <<cloudConfiguration,Cloud Configuration>> for more information.

== Disabling Environment Detection

The automatic detection of environments can be disabled setting the `micronaut.env.deduction` system property or the `MICRONAUT_ENV_DEDUCTION` environment variable to `false`. This will prevent Micronaut from detecting current environments, while still using any environments that are specifically provided as shown above.

.Disabling environment detection via system property
[source,bash]
----
$  java -Dmicronaut.env.deduction=false -jar myapp.jar
----

Alternatively, you can disable environment deduction using the api:context.ApplicationContextBuilder[]'s `deduceEnvironment` method when setting up your application.
