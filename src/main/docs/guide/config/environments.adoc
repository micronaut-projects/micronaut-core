The application environment is modelled by the api:context.env.Environment[] interface, which allows specifying one or many unique environment names when creating an api:context.ApplicationContext[].

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.env.EnvironmentSpec[tags="env",indent=0,title="Initializing the Environment"]

The active environment names allow loading different configuration files depending on the environment, and also using the ann:.context.annotation.Requires[] annotation to conditionally load beans or bean ann:.context.annotation.Configuration[] packages.

In addition, Micronaut attempts to detect the current environments. For example within a Spock or JUnit test the api:context.env.Environment#TEST[] environment is automatically active.

Additional active environments can be specified using the `micronaut.environments` system property or the `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS` environment variable. These are specified as a comma-separated list. For example:

.Specifying environments
[source,bash]
----
$ java -Dmicronaut.environments=foo,bar -jar myapp.jar
----

The above activates environments called `foo` and `bar`.

Finally, Cloud environment names are also detected. See the section on <<cloudConfiguration,Cloud Configuration>> for more information.

== Environment Priority

Micronaut loads property sources based on the environments specified, and if the same property key exists in multiple property sources specific to an environment, the environment order determines which value to use.

Micronaut uses the following hierarchy for environment processing (lowest to highest priority):

* Deduced environments
* Environments from the `micronaut.environments` system property
* Environments from the `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS` environment variable
* Environments specified explicitly through the application context builder
+
NOTE: This also applies to `@MicronautTest(environments = ...)`
+


== Disabling Environment Detection

Automatic detection of environments can be disabled by setting the `micronaut.env.deduction` system property or the `MICRONAUT_ENV_DEDUCTION` environment variable to `false`. This prevents Micronaut from detecting current environments, while still using any environments that are specifically provided as shown above.

.Disabling environment detection via system property
[source,bash]
----
$  java -Dmicronaut.env.deduction=false -jar myapp.jar
----

Alternatively, you can disable environment deduction using the api:context.ApplicationContextBuilder[] `deduceEnvironment` method when setting up your application.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.context.env.DefaultEnvironmentSpec[tags="disableEnvDeduction",indent=0,title="Using ApplicationContextBuilder to disable environment deduction"]

== Default Environment

Micronaut supports the concept of one or many default environments. A default environment is one that is only applied if no other environments are explicitly specified or deduced. Environments can be explicitly specified either through the application context builder `Micronaut.build().environments(...)`, through the `micronaut.environments` system property, or the `MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS` environment variable. Environments can be deduced to automatically apply the environment appropriate for cloud deployments. If an environment is found through any of the above means, the default environment will *not* be applied.

To set the default environments, modify your application main method:

[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Micronaut.build(args)
             .mainClass(Application.class)
             .defaultEnvironments("dev")
             .start();
}
----

== Micronaut Banner

Since Micronaut 2.3 a banner is shown when the application starts. It is enabled by default and it also shows the Micronaut version.

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
$ ./gradlew run
 __  __ _                                  _
|  \/  (_) ___ _ __ ___  _ __   __ _ _   _| |_
| |\/| | |/ __| '__/ _ \| '_ \ / _` | | | | __|
| |  | | | (__| | | (_) | | | | (_| | |_| | |_
|_|  |_|_|\___|_|  \___/|_| |_|\__,_|\__,_|\__|
  Micronaut ({version})

17:07:22.997 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 611ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

To customize the banner with your own ASCII Art (just plain ASCII at this moment), create the file `src/main/resources/micronaut-banner.txt` and it will be used instead.

To disable it, modify your `Application` class:

[source,java]
----
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Micronaut.build(args)
                 .banner(false) // <1>
                 .start();
    }
}
----
<1> Disable the banner
