Micronaut supports any JVM language that implements the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/package-summary.html[Java Annotation Processor] API.

Although Groovy does not support this API, special support has been built using AST transformations. The current list of supported languages is: Java, Groovy, and Kotlin (via the `kapt` tool).

NOTE: Theoretically any language that supports a way to analyze the AST at compile time could be supported. The pkg:inject.writer[] package includes language-neutral classes that build api:inject.BeanDefinition[] classes at compile time using the ASM tool.

The following sections cover language-specific features and considerations for using Micronaut.
