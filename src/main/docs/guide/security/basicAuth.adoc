Micronaut supports https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[Basic HTTP Authentication Scheme] out-of-the-box.

In order to enable Basic Auth, first you need to disable JWT Token authentication and enable Basic Auth:


[source, yaml]
----
include::{testssecurity}/security/BasicAuthSpec.groovy[tag=yamlconfig,indent=0]
----

After credentials are read from the HTTP Header, they are feed into an link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/Authenticator.html[Authenticator]
which attempts to validate them.

|===

| Configuration Property | Default Value | Description

| `micronaut.security.basicAuth.headerName` | `Authorization` | Header name
