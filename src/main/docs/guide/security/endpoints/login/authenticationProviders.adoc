To authenticate users you must provide implementations of link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/AuthenticationProvider.html[AuthenticationProvider].

Micronaut ships with link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/providers/DelegatingAuthenticationProvider.html[DelegatingAuthenticationProvider] which can be typically used
in environments where you store User credentails in a persistence mechanism such as database. However, it is not enabled unless you provide implementations for link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/providers/UserFetcher.html[UserFetcher],
link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/providers/PasswordEncoder.html[PasswordEncoder] and  link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/authentication/providers/AuthoritiesFetcher.html[AuthoritiesFetcher]
