NOTE: This controller can only be enabled if you are using JWT authentication.

By default, issued access tokens expire after a period of time, and they are paired with refresh tokens. To
ease the refresh, you can enable link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/endpoints/OauthController.html[OauthController], with configuration property:

|===

| Configuration Property | Default Value | Possible Values

| `micronaut.security.endpoints.oauth.enabled` | false | true or false
| `micronaut.security.endpoints.oauth.path` | `/oauth/access_token` | default path for `POST` requests.


|===

The controller exposes an endpoint as defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6[section 6 of the OAuth 2.0 spec] - Refreshing an Access Token.

By default, issued Refresh tokens never expire, and can be used to obtain a new access token by sending a POST request to the `/oauth/access_token` endpoint:

[source,bash]
.Sample HTTP request to obtain an access token
----
POST /myApp/oauth/access_token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ....
----

As you can see, is a form request with 2 parameters:

`grant_type`: must be `refresh_token` always.

`refresh_token`: the refresh token obtained previously.

TIP: By default refresh tokens never expire, they must be securely stored in your client application.
See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.4[section 10.4 of the OAuth 2.0 spec] for more information.
