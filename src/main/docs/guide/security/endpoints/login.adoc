You can enable `LoginController`, which exposes an endpoint as defined by link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/endpoints/LoginControllerApi.html[LoginControllerApi], with configuration property:

|===

| Configuration Property | Default Value | Possible Values

| `micronaut.security.endpoints.login` | false | true or false

|===

The response payload contains link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/render/AccessRefreshToken.html[AccessRefreshToken] which
encapsulates two JWT tokens. One access token which you will use in your subsequents calls to the server and
a refresh token which you will use to get new access tokens once the access token expires.
