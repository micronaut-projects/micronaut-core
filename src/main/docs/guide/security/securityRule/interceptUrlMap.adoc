Moreover, you can configure endpoint authentication and authorization access with an Intercept URL Map:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testssecurity}/security/securityRule/intercepturlmap/InterceptUrlMapSpec.groovy[tag=yamlconfig,indent=0]
----

<1> Enable access to authenticated and not authenticated users
<2> Enable access for everyone authenticated
<3> Enable access for users who are granted any of the specified roles.

As you see in the previous code listing, any endpoint is identified by a combination of pattern
and an optional HTTP Method
