You can configure endpoint authentication and authorization access with an Intercept URL Map:

[source, yaml]
----
micronaut:
  security:
    enabled: true
    interceptUrlMap:
      -
        pattern: /images/*
        httpMethod: GET
        access:
          - isAnonymous() # <1>
      -
        pattern: /books
        access:
          - isAuthenticated() # <2>
      -
        pattern: /books/grails
        httpMethod: GET
        access:
          - ROLE_GRAILS # <3>
          - ROLE_GROOVY
----

<1> Enable anonymous access
<2> Enable access for everyone authenticated
<3> Enable access for users who are granted any of the specified roles.

As you see in the previous code listing, any endpoint is identified by a combination of pattern
an an optional HTTP Method
