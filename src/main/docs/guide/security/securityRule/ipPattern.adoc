When you turn on security, traffic coming from any ip address is allowed by default.

You can however reject traffic not coming from a white list of IP Patterns as illustrated below:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testssecurity}/security/securityRule/IpPatternSpec.groovy[tag=yamlconfig,indent=0]
----


In the previous code, the link:{api}io/micronaut/security/rules/IpPatternsRule.html[IpPatternsRule] rejects traffic not coming
either `127.0.0.1` or `192.168.1.*` range.
