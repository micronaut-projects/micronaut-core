[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `rabbitmq` feature to include RabbitMQ support in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features rabbitmq
----
====


To get started with RabbitMQ in Micronaut, add the following dependency:

dependency:io.micronaut.rabbitmq:micronaut-rabbitmq[]

A RabbitMQ connection factory bean will be provided based on the configuration values supplied under the `rabbitmq` configuration key. All setter methods on link:https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-java-client/api/current/com/rabbitmq/client/ConnectionFactory.html[ConnectionFactory] are available to be configured.

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
rabbitmq:
    uri: amqp://user:pass@host:10000/vhost
    requestedFrameMax: 10
    requestedChannelMax: 10
    connectionTimeout: 5000
