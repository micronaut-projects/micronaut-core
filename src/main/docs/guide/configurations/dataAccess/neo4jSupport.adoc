Micronaut features dedicated support for automatically configuring the https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/drivers/[Neo4j Bolt Driver] for the popular https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] Graph Database.

== Configuring Neo4j Bolt
[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `neo4j-bolt` feature to configure the Neo4j Bolt driver in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features neo4j-bolt
----
====

To configure the Neo4j Bolt driver you should first add the `neo4j-bolt` module to your classpath:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
compile "io.micronaut.configuration:micronaut-neo4j-bolt"
----

You should then configure the URI of the Neo4j server you wish to communicate with in `application.yml`:

.Configuring `neo4j.uri`
[source,yaml]
----
neo4j:
    uri: bolt://localhost
----

TIP: The `neo4j.uri` setting should be in the format as described in the https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/drivers/client-applications/#driver-connection-uris[Connection URIs] section of the Neo4j documentation


Once you have the above configuration in place you can inject an instance of the `org.neo4j.driver.v1.Driver` bean, which features both a synchronous blocking API and a non-blocking API based on `CompletableFuture`.

=== Customizing Neo4j Configuration

The configuration can be further customized with all the options available using the api:configuration.neo4j.bolt.Neo4jBoltConfiguration[] class.

The `Neo4jBoltConfiguration` also exposes all the options for the `org.neo4j.driver.v1.Config.ConfigBuilder` class.

Below represents an example configuration:

.Customizing the Bolt Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
neo4j:
    uri: bolt://localhost
    maxConnectionPoolSize: 50
    connectionAcquisitionTimeout: 30s
----

TIP: You can also create a api:context.event.BeanCreatedEventListener[] bean and listen for the creation of the api:configuration.neo4j.bolt.Neo4jBoltConfiguration[] to further programmatically customize configuration

== Embedding Neo4j for Testing

You can embed Neo4j for testing by including a dependency on the Neo4j test harness:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
testRuntime "org.neo4j.test:neo4j-harness:3.3.3"
----

If the Neo4j server is not already running on the configured port an embedded version will be started.

You can configure the options for the embedded Neo4j server using the `neo4j.embedded` settings exposed by api:configuration.neo4j.bolt.Neo4jBoltConfiguration[].

One useful option is `ephemeral` which ensures the data is cleaned up between test runs. For example in `application-test.yml`:

.Using ephemeral
[source,yaml]
----
neo4j:
    embedded:
        ephemeral: true
----


== Neo4j Health Checks

When the `neo4j-bolt` module is activated a api:configuration.neo4j.bolt.health.Neo4jHealthIndicator[] is activated resulting in the `/health` endpoint and api:health.CurrentHealthStatus[] interface resolving the health of the Neo4j connection.

See the section on the <<healthEndpoint, Health Endpoint>> for more information.

== Using GORM for Neo4j

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `neo4j-gorm` feature to configure GORM for Neo4j in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features neo4j-gorm
----
====

For Groovy users and users familiar with Grails, special support has been added to Micronaut for using http://gorm.grails.org/latest/neo4j/manual[GORM for Neo4j].

To add support for GORM for Neo4j, first configure the Neo4j connection as per instructions earlier in the guide, then add the following dependency to your application:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
compile "io.micronaut.configuration:micronaut-neo4j-gorm"
----

The following should be noted regarding using GORM for Neo4j in Micronaut:

* Each class you wish to be a GORM entity should be annotated with the `grails.gorm.annotation.Entity` annotation.
* Each method that interacts with GORM should be annotated with GORM's `grails.gorm.transactions.Transactional` to ensure a session is present. You can also add the `@Transactional` annotation to the class.
* By default Micronaut will scan for entities relative to your `Application` class. If you wish to customize this specify additional packages via the api:context.ApplicationContextBuilder[] when starting your application.
