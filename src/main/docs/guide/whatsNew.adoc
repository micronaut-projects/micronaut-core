=== Compile Time Bean Introspection

A compilation time replacement for jdk:java.beans.Introspector[] has been added which allows introspecting and creating bean instances without using reflection, improving performance, memory consumption and GraalVM support.

See the new section on <<introspection, Bean Introspection>> for more information.

=== Cold Start and Performance Improvements

Micronaut 1.1 cold start performance has been improved through a variety of optimizations including compilation time indexing of common bean types. Users should see superior cold start performance for both Microservices and Functions.


=== AWS API Gateway Proxy Support

Support for AWS API Gateway Proxy has been added allowing AWS Lambda's to be defined as regular controllers. See the documentation on https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#apiProxy[AWS API Gateway Proxy Support] for more information and links to examples.

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features aws-api-gateway
----
====

=== GraalVM Native Improvements

Support for GraalVM Substrate (`nativeimage`) has been improved in a number of different ways.

* *Framework Improvements* - Framework level dynamic classloading and reflection has been completely removed thus making it easier to get applications running on GraalVM `nativeimage` and reducing the number of customizations necessary.
* *Build Time Reflection Data* - Thanks to the aforementioned feature, the older `GraalClassLoadingAnalyzer` runtime step has been removed and replaced by build time generation of `reflection-config.json` for classes that do require it (typically third party libraries).
* *Simplified Image Generation* - You can now generate a native image with just `native-image --class-path myjar.jar` without any additional flags. Since Micronaut now computes the appropriate GraalVM configuration at compilation time.


=== AWS Lambda Custom Runtime + GraalVM Support

Support for creating AWS API Gateway applications (see above) that are compiled into GraalVM native images and run using an AWS Lambda Custom Runtime has been added. This reduces cold starts on Lambda to 100-200ms.

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features aws-api-gateway-graal
----
====

=== AWS Lambda Alexa Skill Support

Support for creating https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/#alexa[Alexa Skills with Micronaut] has been added.

[TIP]

=== Micronaut Test Templates

The CLI has been updated to generate tests that use https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/index.html[Micronaut Test] for JUnit 5 and Spock.

=== Micrometer 1.1 and @Timed Support

Micrometer has been upgraded to 1.1 and support for https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_the_code_timed_code_annotation[@Timed] AOP advice added.

=== Kafka 2.1 and Kafka Improvements

Kafka support has been improved with the release of https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-kafka/1.1.x/guide/[Micronaut Kafka] 1.1 including supports for metrics, distributed tracing and Kafka 2.1.

=== API Versioning Support

API versioning is now supported. See the <<apiVersioning, API Versioning>> documentation for more information on how to use this feature. Thanks for https://github.com/BogdanOros[Bogdan Oros] for contributing this feature.

=== Jackson `@JsonView` Support

Support for using `@JsonView` on controller methods has been added can be optionally enabled by setting `jackson.json-view.enabled` to `true` in `application.yml`. Thanks to https://github.com/mmindenhall[Mark Mindenhall] for contributing this feature.

=== Support for Spring Cloud Config Server

If you are already using https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-config[Spring Config Server] then Micronaut now features native integration for distributed configuration.

See the <<distributedConfigurationSpringCloud, Documentation on Distributed Configuration with Spring Cloud Config>> for more information.

Thanks to https://github.com/thiagolocatelli[Thiago Locatelli] and https://github.com/MichelSchudel[Michel Schudel] for contributing this feature.

=== Refactoring of File Responses

In an effort to make a more consistent and understandable API, some methods and classes related to sending file responses have been deprecated. api:http.server.types.files.SystemFile[] is the replacement for api:http.server.types.files.AttachedFile[] and the constructors of api:http.server.types.files.StreamedFile[] have been deprecated in favor of new constructors that better convey the intended functionality.

Note that api:http.server.types.files.SystemFile[] behaves differently from api:http.server.types.files.AttachedFile[] in that responses are by default sent inline instead of attached. In addition, support for sending attached responses has been added to api:http.server.types.files.StreamedFile[]. The following methods can be used to attach a system or streamed file.

* api:http.server.types.files.StreamedFile#attach-java.lang.String-[StreamedFile#attach(String)]
* api:http.server.types.files.SystemFile#attach--[SystemFile#attach()]
* api:http.server.types.files.SystemFile#attach-java.lang.String-[SystemFile#attach(String)]

=== Support for Freemarker Views

Support for rendering <<freemarker,Freemarker Views>> has been added. Thanks to https://github.com/jerolba[Jeronimo LÃ³pez] for contributing this feature.

=== Constraint Bean Support

For those using the `micronaut-hibernate-validator` configuration, constraints will now be attempted to be retrieved from the bean context. This means you can now use dependency injection in your custom constraints.

=== Support for JCache Caching

Support has been added for the JCache specification. If you define a `javax.cache.CacheManager` bean it will be used for caching. For example:

.Using JCache Caching
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.whatsNew.CacheFactory[tags="imports,class"]

=== Support for JAsync SQL

Support for https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/1.1.x/guide/index.html#jasync[JAsync SQL] has been added, which includes non-blocking drivers for both Postgres and MySQL. Thanks to https://github.com/oshai[Ohad Shai] for contributing this feature.

=== Major Improvements for Multipart File Uploads

Several issues and improvements have been made in regards to file uploads in comparison to the previous version of Micronaut. These fixes have been substantial enough that they have caused the behavior of uploads to change, however these changes should not break any existing use cases. To summarize the issues:

* Routes were not in control of the flow of bytes coming from the client with multipart uploads
* It was not possible to read and release a chunk of data at a time. The entire upload would be put into memory or disk
* Mixed (memory/disk with a threshold) uploads are not supported

The following changes have been implemented:

* Routes gain control of the data flow as soon as they are executed. A route cannot be executed until all of its arguments are fulfilled, so data will reside on memory or disk until the route can be executed.
* After processing a chunk of data it is immediately released. For memory uploads this means the data is immediately freed. For disk uploads the data remains on disk until after processing.
* Two new configuration options are available to support mixed uploads: `micronaut.server.multipart.mixed` and `micronaut.server.multipart.threshold`. When data needs to be buffered, mixed uploads will initially store data in memory. Once the threshold is reached, the data will be erased from memory and moved entirely onto disk.

=== Option to Disable Environment Detection

Environment detection can be disabled through a method on the application context builder, system property, or evnironment variable.

See the <<environments, Environment>> documentation for more information.
