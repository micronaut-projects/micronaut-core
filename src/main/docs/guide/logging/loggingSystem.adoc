The Micronaut Framework has a notion of a logging system. In short, it is a simple API to be able to set log levels in the logging implementation at runtime. Default implementations are provided for Logback and Log4j2. The behavior of the logging system can be overridden by creating your own implementation of api:logging.LoggingSystem[] and replace the implementation being used with the ann:context.annotation.Replaces[] annotation.
