Log levels can be configured via properties defined in `application.yml` (and environment variables) with the `logger.levels` prefix:

[source,yaml]
----
logger:
  levels:
    foo.bar: ERROR
----

The same configuration can be achieved by setting the environment variable `LOGGER_LEVELS_FOO_BAR`. Note that there is currently no way to set log levels for unconventional prefixes such as `foo.barBaz`.

==== Disabling a Logger with Properties

To disable a logger, you need to set the logger level to `OFF`:

[source,yaml]
----
logger:
  levels:
    io.verbose.logger.who.CriedWolf: OFF <1>
----
1. This will disable ALL logging for the class `io.verbose.logger.who.CriedWolf`


Note that the ability to control log levels via config is controlled via the api:logging.LoggingSystem[] interface. Currently, Micronaut includes a single implementation that allows setting log levels for the Logback library. If you use another library, you should provide a bean that implements this interface.
