You may need to resolve the originating IP address of an HTTP Request. Micronaut ships with an implementation of api:http.server.util.HttpClientAddressResolver[].

The default implementation will resolve the client address in the following places in order:

1. The configured header
2. The `Forwarded` header
3. The `X-Forwarded-For` header
4. The remote address on the request

The first priority header name can be configured with `micronaut.server.client-address-header`.
