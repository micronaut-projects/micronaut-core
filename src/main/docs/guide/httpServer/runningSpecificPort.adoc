By default the server runs on port 8080. However, you can set the server to run on a specific port:

[source, yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    port: 8086
----

TIP: This is also possible to be configured from an environment variable: `MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT=8086`

To run on a random port:

[source, yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    port: -1
----

TIP: If an explicit port is set, that may cause tests to fail because multiple servers are starting simultaneously. To prevent that, set the port to be random in the test environment configuration.
