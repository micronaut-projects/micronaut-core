By default the server runs on port 8080. However, you can set the server to run on a specific port:

[source, yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    port: 8086
----

TIP: This is also possible to be configured from an environment variable: `MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT=8086`

To run on a random port:

[source, yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    port: -1
----

Your build tool (e.g. gradle) might pick up the micronaut.server.port from application.yml also _for your tests_ (via classpath scanning).

In that case you'd need to specify that tests should explicitly use a random port (like above) in your src/**test**/resources/application-test.yml
