By default the server runs on port 8080. However, you can set the server to run on a specific port:

[source, yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    port: 8086
----

TIP: This is also configurable from an environment variable, e.g. `MICRONAUT_SERVER_PORT=8086`

To run on a random port:

[source, yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    port: -1
----

TIP: Setting an explicit port may cause tests to fail if multiple servers start simultaneously on the same port. To prevent that, specify a random port in the test environment configuration.
