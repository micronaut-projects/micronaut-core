Since Micronaut 2.x, Micronaut's Netty-based HTTP server can be configured to support HTTP/2.

==== Configuring the Server for HTTP/2

The first step to doing so is setting the supported HTTP version is the server configuration:

.Enabling HTTP/2 Support
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    http-version: 2.0
----

With this configuration in place Micronaut will enable support for the `h2c` protocol (see https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#discover-http[HTTP/2 over cleartext]) which is fine for development.

Since browsers don't support `h2c` and in general https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#discover-https[HTTP/2 over TLS] (the `h2` protocol) is recommended for production you should enable <<https, HTTPS support>> support. For development this can be done with:

.Enabling `h2` Protocol Support
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    buildSelfSigned: true
  server:
    http-version: 2.0
----

For production, see the <<https, configuring HTTPS>> section of the documentation.

Note that if you deployment environment is JDK 8 or if you wish for improved support for OpenSSL you will need to define the following dependencies on Netty Tomcat Native:

dependency:io.netty:netty-tcnative:2.0.29.Final[scope="runtimeOnly"]

dependency:io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static:2.0.29.Final[scope="runtimeOnly"]

In addition to a dependency on the appropriate native library for your architecture. For example:

.Configuring Tomcat Native
[source,groovy]
----
runtimeOnly "io.netty:netty-tcnative-boringssl-static:2.0.29.Final:${Os.isFamily(Os.FAMILY_MAC) ? 'osx-x86_64' : 'linux-x86_64'}"
----

See the documentation on https://netty.io/wiki/forked-tomcat-native.html[Tomcat Native] for more information.

==== HTTP/2 Clients

By default Micronaut's HTTP client is configured to support HTTP 1.1. To enable support for HTTP/2 you can do so globally by setting the supported HTTP version if configuration:

.Enabling HTTP/2 in Clients
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    client:
      http-version: 2.0
----

Or by specifying the HTTP version to use when injecting the client:

.Injecting a HTTP/2 Client
[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Client(httpVersion=HttpVersion.HTTP_2_0)
RxHttpClient client;
----
