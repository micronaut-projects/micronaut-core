Micronaut includes api:views.velocity.VelocityViewsRenderer[] which uses
the http://velocity.apache.org[Apache Velocity] Java-based template engine.

In addition to the <<views, Views>> dependency, add the following dependency on your classpath.

dependency:velocity-engine-core[groupId="org.apache.velocity",scope="runtime",version="2.0"]

The example shown in the <<views, Views>> section, could be rendered with the following Velocity template:

[source,html]
.src/main/resources/views/home.vm

include::{testsviews}/resources/views/home.vm[tag=html]
