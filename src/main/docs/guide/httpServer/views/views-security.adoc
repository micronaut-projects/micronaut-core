The views project has integration with the Micronaut security project. api:views.model.security.SecurityViewModelProcessor[] is enabled by default and injects the current username in the view. The following properties allow you to customize the injection:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.views.model.security.SecurityViewModelProcessorConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

In a controller, you can return a model without specifying in the model the authenticated user:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/myapp/BooksController.java
----
include::{testsviews}/groovy/io/micronaut/views/model/security/BooksController.java[tags=class]
----

and still access the authenticated user in the view (for example a velocity template):

[source,html]
.src/main/resources/views/books.vm
----
include::{testsviews}/resources/views/securitydecorator.vm[tag=html]
----

You can access information about the current user with the `security` map.
