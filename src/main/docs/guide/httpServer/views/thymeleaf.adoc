Micronaut includes api:views.thymeleaf.ThymeleafViewsRenderer[] which uses
the https://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf] Java template engine.

In addition to the <<views, Views>> dependency, add the following dependency on your classpath. For example, in `build.gradle`

[source, groovy]
----
runtime "org.thymeleaf:thymeleaf:3.0.9.RELEASE"
----

Thymeleaf integration instantiates a `ClassLoaderTemplateResolver`.
The properties used can be customized by overriding the values of api:io.micronaut.views.ThymeleafConfigurationProperties[].

The example shown in the <<views, Views>> section, could be rendered with the following Thymeleaf template:

[source,html]
.src/main/resources/views/home.html
----
include::{testsviews}/../../../../resources/views/home.html[]
----

and layout:

[source,html]
.src/main/resources/views/layoutFile.html
----
include::{testsviews}/../../../../resources/views/layoutFile.html[]
----
