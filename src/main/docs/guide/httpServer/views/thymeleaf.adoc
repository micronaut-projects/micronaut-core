Micronaut includes api:views.thymeleaf.ThymeleafViewsRenderer[] which uses
the https://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf] Java template engine.

In addition to the <<views, Views>> dependency, add the following dependency on your classpath.

dependency:thymeleaf[groupId="org.thymeleaf",scope="runtime",version="3.0.11.RELEASE"]

Thymeleaf integration instantiates a `ClassLoaderTemplateResolver`.

The properties used can be customized by overriding the values of:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.views.thymeleaf.ThymeleafViewsRendererConfigurationProperties.adoc[]

The example shown in the <<views, Views>> section, could be rendered with the following Thymeleaf template:

[source,html]
.src/main/resources/views/home.html
----
include::{testsviews}/resources/views/home.html[]
----

and layout:

[source,html]
.src/main/resources/views/layoutFile.html
----
include::{testsviews}/resources/views/layoutFile.html[]
----
