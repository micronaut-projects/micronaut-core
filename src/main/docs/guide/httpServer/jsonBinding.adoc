The most common data interchange format nowadays is JSON.

In fact, the defaults in the api:http.annotation.Controller[] annotation specify that the controllers in Micronaut consume and produce JSON by default.

In order to do so in a non-blocking manner Micronaut builds on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] Asynchronous JSON parsing API and Netty such that the reading of incoming JSON is done in a non-blocking manner.

== Binding using Reactive Frameworks

From a developer perspective however, you can generally just work with Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and can optionally use a Reactive framework such as RxJava or Reactor. The following is an example of a controller that reads and saves an incoming POJO in a non-blocking way from JSON:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="class,single,endclass", indent=0, title="Using RxJava 2 to Read the JSON"]

<1> The method receives a RxJava rx:Single[] which emits the POJO once the JSON has been read
<2> The `map` method is used to store the instance in `Map`
<3> An api:http.HttpResponse[] is returned

Using CURL from the command line you can POST JSON to the `/people` URI for the server to receive it:

.Using CURL to Post JSON
----
$ curl -X POST localhost:8080/people -d '{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Flintstone","age":45}'
----

== Binding Using CompletableFuture

The same method as the previous example can also be written with the jdk:java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture[] API instead:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="class,future,endclass", indent=0, title="Using CompletableFuture to Read the JSON"]

The above example uses the `thenApply` method to achieve the same as the previous example.

== Binding using POJOs

Note however you can just as easily write:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="class,regular,endclass", indent=0, title="Binding JSON POJOs"]

Micronaut will only execute your method once the data has been read in a non-blocking manner.

TIP: The output produced by Jackson can be customized in a variety of manners, from defining Jackson modules to using https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations/wiki/Jackson-Annotations[Jackson's annotations]

== Jackson Configuration

The Jackson ObjectMapper can be configured through normal configuration with the api:io.micronaut.jackson.JacksonConfiguration[] class.

All jackson configuration keys start with `jackson`.

|=======
| dateFormat | String | The date format
| locale     | String | Uses link:{javase}java/util/Locale.html#forLanguageTag-java.lang.String-[Locale.forLanguageTag]. Example: `en-US`
| timeZone   | String |Uses link:{javase}java/util/TimeZone.html#getTimeZone-java.lang.String-[TimeZone.getTimeZone]. Example: `PST`
| serializationInclusion | String | One of link:{jackson-annotations}com/fasterxml/jackson/annotation/JsonInclude.Include.html[JsonInclude.Include]. Example: `ALWAYS`
| propertyNamingStrategy | String | Name of an instance of link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/PropertyNamingStrategy.html[PropertyNamingStrategy]. Example: `SNAKE_CASE`
| defaultTyping          | String | The global defaultTyping for polymorphic type handling from enum link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.html[ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping]. Example: `NON_FINAL`
|=======

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
jackson:
  serializationInclusion: ALWAYS
----

=== Features

All features can be configured with their name as the key and a boolean to indicate enabled or disabled.

|======
|serialization | Map | link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/SerializationFeature.html[SerializationFeature]
|deserialization | Map | link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/DeserializationFeature.html[DeserializationFeature]
|mapper | Map | link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/MapperFeature.html[MapperFeature]
|parser | Map | link:{jackson-core}com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser.Feature.html[JsonParser.Feature]
|generator | Map | link:{jackson-core}com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonGenerator.Feature.html[JsonGenerator.Feature]
|======

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
jackson:
  serialization:
    indentOutput: true
    writeDatesAsTimestamps: false
  deserialization:
    useBigIntegerForInts: true
    failOnUnknownProperties: false
----

=== Support for `@JsonView`

You can use the `@JsonView` annotation to controller methods if you set `jackson.json-view.enabled` to `true` in `application.yml`.

Jackson's `@JsonView` annotation allows you to control which properties are exposes on a per response basis. See https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-json-view-annotation[Jackson JSON Views] for more information.

=== Beans

In addition to configuration, beans can be registered to customize Jackson. All beans that extend any of the following classes will be registered with the object mapper.

* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/Module.html[Module]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/JsonDeserializer.html[JsonDeserializer]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/JsonSerializer.html[JsonSerializer]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/KeyDeserializer.html[KeyDeserializer]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/BeanDeserializerModifier.html[BeanDeserializerModifier]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ser/BeanSerializerModifier.html[BeanSerializerModifier]

=== Service Loader

Any modules registered via the service loader will also be added to the default object mapper.
