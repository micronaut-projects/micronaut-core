The most common data interchange format nowadays is JSON.

In fact, the defaults in the api:http.annotation.Controller[] annotation specify that the controllers in Micronaut consume and produce JSON by default.

To do so in a non-blocking manner, Micronaut builds on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] Asynchronous JSON parsing API and Netty, such that the reading of incoming JSON is done in a non-blocking manner.

== Binding using Reactive Frameworks

From a developer perspective however, you can generally just work with Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and can optionally use a Reactive framework such as https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava] or https://projectreactor.io[Project Reactor]. The following is an example of a controller that reads and saves an incoming POJO in a non-blocking way from JSON:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="class,single,endclass", indent=0, title="Using Reactive Streams to Read the JSON"]

<1> The method receives a `Publisher` which emits the POJO once the JSON has been read
<2> The `map` method stores the instance in a `Map`
<3> An api:http.HttpResponse[] is returned

Using cURL from the command line, you can POST JSON to the `/people` URI:

.Using cURL to Post JSON
----
$ curl -X POST localhost:8080/people -d '{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Flintstone","age":45}'
----

== Binding Using CompletableFuture

The same method as the previous example can also be written with the jdk:java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture[] API instead:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="class,future,endclass", indent=0, title="Using CompletableFuture to Read the JSON"]

The above example uses the `thenApply` method to achieve the same as the previous example.

== Binding using POJOs

Note however you can just as easily write:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="class,regular,endclass", indent=0, title="Binding JSON POJOs"]

Micronaut only executes your method once the data has been read in a non-blocking manner.

TIP: The output produced by Jackson can be customized in a variety of ways, from defining Jackson modules to using https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations/wiki/Jackson-Annotations[Jackson annotations]

== Jackson Configuration

The Jackson `ObjectMapper` can be configured through configuration with the api:io.micronaut.jackson.JacksonConfiguration[] class.

All Jackson configuration keys start with `jackson`.

|=======
| dateFormat | String | The date format
| locale     | String | Uses link:{javase}java/util/Locale.html#forLanguageTag-java.lang.String-[Locale.forLanguageTag]. Example: `en-US`
| timeZone   | String |Uses link:{javase}java/util/TimeZone.html#getTimeZone-java.lang.String-[TimeZone.getTimeZone]. Example: `PST`
| serializationInclusion | String | One of link:{jackson-annotations}com/fasterxml/jackson/annotation/JsonInclude.Include.html[JsonInclude.Include]. Example: `ALWAYS`
| propertyNamingStrategy | String | Name of an instance of link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/PropertyNamingStrategy.html[PropertyNamingStrategy]. Example: `SNAKE_CASE`
| defaultTyping          | String | The global defaultTyping for polymorphic type handling from enum link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.html[ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping]. Example: `NON_FINAL`
|=======

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
jackson:
  serializationInclusion: ALWAYS
----

=== Features

All features can be configured with their name as the key and a boolean to indicate enabled or disabled.

|======
|serialization | Map | link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/SerializationFeature.html[SerializationFeature]
|deserialization | Map | link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/DeserializationFeature.html[DeserializationFeature]
|mapper | Map | link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/MapperFeature.html[MapperFeature]
|parser | Map | link:{jackson-core}com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser.Feature.html[JsonParser.Feature]
|generator | Map | link:{jackson-core}com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonGenerator.Feature.html[JsonGenerator.Feature]
|factory | Map | link:{jackson-core}com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonFactory.Feature.html[JsonFactory.Feature]
|======

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
jackson:
  serialization:
    indentOutput: true
    writeDatesAsTimestamps: false
  deserialization:
    useBigIntegerForInts: true
    failOnUnknownProperties: false
----

=== Further customising `JsonFactory`

There may be situations where you wish to customise the `JsonFactory` used by the `ObjectMapper` beyond the configuration of features (for example to allow custom character escaping).
This can be achieved by providing your own `JsonFactory` bean, or by providing a `BeanCreatedEventListener<JsonFactory>` which configures the default bean on startup.

=== Support for `@JsonView`

You can use the `@JsonView` annotation on controller methods if you set `jackson.json-view.enabled` to `true` in `application.yml`.

Jackson's `@JsonView` annotation lets you control which properties are exposed on a per-response basis. See https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-json-view-annotation[Jackson JSON Views] for more information.

=== Beans

In addition to configuration, beans can be registered to customize Jackson. All beans that extend any of the following classes are registered with the object mapper:

* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/Module.html[Module]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/JsonDeserializer.html[JsonDeserializer]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/JsonSerializer.html[JsonSerializer]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/KeyDeserializer.html[KeyDeserializer]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/BeanDeserializerModifier.html[BeanDeserializerModifier]
* link:{jackson-databind}com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ser/BeanSerializerModifier.html[BeanSerializerModifier]

=== Service Loader

Any modules registered via the service loader are also added to the default object mapper.

=== Number Precision

During JSON parsing, the framework may convert any incoming data to an intermediate object model. By default, this model uses `BigInteger`, `long` and `double` for numeric values. This means some information that could be represented by `BigDecimal` may be lost. For example, numbers with many decimal places that cannot be represented by `double` may be truncated, even if the target type for deserialization uses `BigDecimal`. Metadata on the number of trailing zeroes (`BigDecimal.precision()`), e.g. the difference between `0.12` and `0.120`, is also discarded.

If you need full accuracy for number types, use the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
jackson:
  deserialization:
    useBigIntegerForInts: true
    useBigDecimalForFloats: true
----
