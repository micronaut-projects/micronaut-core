Although Micronaut is primarily designed around message encoding / decoding there are occasions where it is convenient to render a view on the server side.

The `views` module provides support for view rendering on the server side and does so by rendering views on the I/O thread pool in order to avoid blocking the Netty event loop.

To use the view rendering features described in this section, add the following dependency on your classpath.

dependency:micronaut-views[]

Views and templates can then be placed in the `src/main/resources/views` directory of your project.

If you wish to use a different folder instead of `views`, set the property `micronaut.views.folder`.

Your controller's method can render the response with a template with the the api:views.View[] annotation.

The following is an example of a controller which renders a template by passing a model as a `java.util.Map` via the returned response object.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/myapp/ViewsController.java
----
include::{testsviews}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=clazz]

include::{testsviews}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=map]

}
----

<1> Use `@View` annotation to indicate the view name which should be used to render a view for the route.

In addition, you can return any POJO object and the properties of the POJO will be exposed to the view for rendering:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/myapp/ViewsController.java
----
include::{testsviews}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=clazz]

include::{testsviews}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=pogo]

}
----

<1> Use `@View` annotation to indicate the view name which should be used to render the POJO responded by the controller.

You can also return a api:views.ModelAndView[] and skip specifying the api:views.View[] annotation.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/myapp/ViewsController.java
----
include::{testsviews}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=clazz]

include::{testsviews}/groovy/io/micronaut/docs/ViewsController.groovy[tags=modelAndView]
----

You can also provide implementations of api:views.model.ViewsModelDecorator[] to decorate the model with
extra properties.

The following sections show different template engines integrations.

To create your own implementation create a class which implements api:views.ViewRenderer[] and annotate it with api:http.annotation.Produces[@Produces] to the media types the view rendering supports producing.
