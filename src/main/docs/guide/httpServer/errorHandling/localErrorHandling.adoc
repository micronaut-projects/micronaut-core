For example, the following method handles JSON parse exceptions from Jackson for the scope of the declaring controller:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="localError", indent=0, title="Local exception handler"]

<1> A method that explicitly handles `JsonSyntaxException` is declared
<2> An instance of api:http.hateoas.JsonError[] is returned.
<3> A custom response is returned to handle the error

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="statusError", indent=0, title="Local status handler"]

<1> The api:http.annotation.Error[] declares which api:http.HttpStatus[] error code to handle (in this case 404)
<2> A api:http.hateoas.JsonError[] instance is returned for all 404 responses
<3> An api:http.HttpStatus#NOT_FOUND[] response is returned

Similar to other controller methods, error handlers can use <<binding, request binding annotations>> on parameters e.g.
to access header values. However, binding the request body comes with additional restrictions depending on the HTTP
server implementation used. If the body has already been bound to a parameter of the original controller method, it may
not be possible to bind the body to a different type, as the original bytes may already have been discarded.
