`ByteBody` itself does not offer direct access to the data. To begin processing, there must be a _primary
operation_ that converts the body into another form that can be used in the application programming model.

A normal `ByteBody` has two groups of streaming primary operations. `toInputStream()` gives access to the body
as a regular `InputStream`. The `toByteArrayPublisher()` and `toByteBufferPublisher()` methods return a reactive stream
of byte arrays or `ByteBuffer`s.

WARNING: `InputStream` is blocking API, and the netty event loop must never be blocked. If you wish to read from the
body using an `InputStream`, take care to do so only on another thread, or to annotate your filter with
`@ExecuteOn(TaskExecutors.BLOCKING)`.

If you need full access to the body, the `buffer()` method returns a `CompletableFuture` that completes with an
`AvailableByteBody` when the full body has been received. `AvailableByteBody` has a few more convenient
primary operations: `toByteArray()`, `toByteBuffer()` and `toString(Charset)`.

Buffering is limited to the number of bytes configured in the `micronaut.server.max-request-buffer-size` property.
