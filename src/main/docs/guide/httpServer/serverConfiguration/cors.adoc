Micronaut supports CORS (link:https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[Cross Origin Resource Sharing]) out of the box. By default, CORS requests will be rejected. To enable processing of CORS requests, modify your configuration. For example with `application.yml`:

.CORS Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
----

By only enabling CORS processing, a "wide open" strategy will be adopted that will allow requests from any origin.

To change the settings for all origins or a specific origin, change the configuration to provide a set of "configurations". By providing any configuration, the default "wide open" configuration is not configured.

.CORS Configurations (... is a placeholder)
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        all:
          ...
        web:
          ...
        mobile:
          ...
----

In the above example, three configurations are being provided. Their names (`all`, `web`, `mobile`) are not important and have no significance inside Micronaut. They are there purely to be able to easily recognize the intended user of the configuration.

The same configuration properties can be applied to each configuration. See link:{api}/io/micronaut/http/server/cors/CorsOriginConfiguration.html[CorsOriginConfiguration] for the reference of properties that can be defined. Each configuration supplied will have its values default to the default values of the corresponding fields.

When a CORS request is made, configurations are searched for allowed origins that are an exact match or match the request origin through a regular expression.

== Allowed Origins

To allow any origin for a given configuration, simply don't include the `allowedOrigins` key in your configuration.

To specify a list of valid origins, set the `allowedOrigins` key of the configuration to a list of strings. Each value can either be a static value (`http://www.foo.com`) or a regular expression (`^http(|s)://www\.google\.com$`).

Any regular expressions are passed to link:{javase}java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile-java.lang.String-[Pattern#compile] and compared to the request origin with link:{javase}java/util/regex/Matcher.html#matches--[Matcher#matches].

.Example CORS Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        web:
          allowedOrigins:
            - http://foo.com
            - ^http(|s):\/\/www\.google\.com$
----

== Allowed Methods

To allow any request method for a given configuration, simply don't include the `allowedMethods` key in your configuration.

To specify a list of allowed methods, set the `allowedMethods` key of the configuration to a list of strings.

.Example CORS Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        web:
          allowedMethods:
            - POST
            - PUT
----

== Allowed Headers

To allow any request header for a given configuration, simply don't include the `allowedHeaders` key in your configuration.

To specify a list of allowed headers, set the `allowedHeaders` key of the configuration to a list of strings.

.Example CORS Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        web:
          allowedHeaders:
            - Content-Type
            - Authorization
----

== Exposed Headers

To configure the list of headers that are sent in the response to a CORS request through the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header, include a list of strings for the `exposedHeaders` key in your configuration. By default no headers are exposed.

.Example CORS Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        web:
          exposedHeaders:
            - Content-Type
            - Authorization
----

== Allow Credentials

Credentials are allowed by default for CORS requests. To disallow credentials, simply set the `allowCredentials` option to `false`.

.Example CORS Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        web:
          allowCredentials: false
----

== Max Age

The default maximum age that preflight requests can be cached is 30 minutes. To change that behavior, specify a value in seconds.

.Example CORS Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        web:
          maxAge: 3600 # 1 hour
----

== Multiple Header Values

By default when a header has multiple values, multiple headers will be sent each with a single value. It is possible to change the behavior to send a single header with the list of values comma separated by setting a configuration option.

[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      single-header: true
