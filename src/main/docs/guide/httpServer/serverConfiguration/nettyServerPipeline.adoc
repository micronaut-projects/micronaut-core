You can customize the Netty server pipeline by writing a <<events, Bean Event Listener>> that listens for the creation of api:io.micronaut.http.server.netty.NettyServerCustomizer.Registry[].

The api:http.netty.channel.ChannelPipelineCustomizer[] interface defines constants for the names of the various handlers the Micronaut framework registers.

As an example the following code sample demonstrates registering the https://github.com/zalando/logbook[Logbook] library which includes additional Netty handlers to perform request and response logging:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.netty.LogbookNettyServerCustomizer[tags="imports,class", indent=0, title="Customizing the Netty server pipeline for Logbook"]

<1> `LogbookNettyServerCustomizer` listens for a api:http.server.netty.NettyServerCustomizer.Registry[] and requires the definition of a `Logbook` bean
<2> The root customizer is initialized without a channel and registered
<3> The actual customizer implements api:http.server.netty.NettyServerCustomizer[]
<4> When a new channel is created, a new, specialized customizer is created for that channel
<5> When the server signals that the stream pipeline has been fully constructed, the logbook handler is registered

WARNING: As of version 4.5.0, the Micronaut netty HTTP server does not use per-request channels for HTTP/2 anymore. This makes many pipeline modifications (including logbook) difficult or impossible to implement. To revert to the old behavior, use the `micronaut.server.netty.legacy-multiplex-handlers=true` property.
