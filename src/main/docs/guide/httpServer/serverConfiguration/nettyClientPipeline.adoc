You can customize the Netty client pipeline by writing a <<events, Bean Event Listener>> that listens for the creation of a api:http.client.netty.NettyClientCustomizer.Registry[].

The api:http.netty.channel.ChannelPipelineCustomizer[] interface defines constants for the names of the various handlers Micronaut registers.

As an example the following code sample demonstrates registering the https://github.com/zalando/logbook[Logbook] library which includes additional Netty handlers to perform request and response logging:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.netty.LogbookNettyClientCustomizer[tags="imports,class", indent=0, title="Customizing the Netty server pipeline for Logbook"]

<1> `LogbookNettyClientCustomizer` listens for a api:http.client.netty.NettyClientCustomizer.Registry[] and requires the definition of a `Logbook` bean
<2> The root customizer is initialized without a channel and registered
<3> The actual customizer implements api:http.client.netty.NettyClientCustomizer[]
<4> When a new channel is created, a new, specialized customizer is created for that channel
<5> When the client signals that the stream pipeline has been fully constructed, the logbook handler is registered

WARNING: Logbook has a https://github.com/zalando/logbook/issues/1216[major bug] that limits its usefulness with netty.
