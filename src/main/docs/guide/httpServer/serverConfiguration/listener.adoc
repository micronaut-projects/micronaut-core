Instead of configuring a single port, you can also specify each listener manually.

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    netty:
      listeners:
        httpListener:
          host: 127.0.0.1
          port: 8086
          ssl: false
        httpsListener:
          port: 8087
          ssl: true
----

- `httpListener` is a listener name, and can be an arbitrary value
- `host` is optional, and by default binds to all interfaces

WARNING: If you specify listeners manually, other configuration such as `micronaut.server.port` will be ignored.

SSL can be enabled or disabled for each listener individually. When enabled, the SSL will be configured <<https, as described above>>.

The embedded server also supports binding to unix domain sockets using netty. This requires the following dependency:

dependency:netty-transport-native-unix-common[groupId="io.netty",artifactId="netty-transport-native-unix-common"]

The server must also be configured to <<serverConfiguration, use native transport>> (epoll or kqueue).

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    netty:
      listeners:
        unixListener:
          family: UNIX
          path: /run/micronaut.socket
          ssl: true
----

- `unixListener` is a listener name, and can be an arbitrary value

NOTE: To use an abstract domain socket instead of a normal one, prefix the path with a NUL character, like `"\0/run/micronaut.socket"`

== systemd socket activation support

The HTTP server can be configured to use an existing file descriptor. With this feature, you can use socket created by systemd and passed to the micronaut process:

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  netty:
    event-loops:
      # use epoll
      parent:
        prefer-native-transport: true
      default:
        prefer-native-transport: true
    listeners:
      systemd:
        fd: 3 # systemd passes the server socket as fd 3
        bind: false # do not bind again, systemd already did this
----

Example `app.service` file:

----
[Unit]
Description=Micronaut HTTP server with socket activation
After=network.target app.socket
Requires=app.socket

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /app.jar
----

Example `app.socket` file:

----
[Socket]
ListenStream=127.0.0.1:8080

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
----

Now your Micronaut application can be started by a client connecting to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

NOTE: The nio transport only supports `fd: 0` ("inetd style"), through the JDK `System.inheritedChannel()` API. If you
wish to use the default `fd: 3` recommended by systemd, you must use the epoll transport.

=== inetd-style socket activation

systemd also supports inetd-style socket activation. In that mode, instead of passing a listening socket fd
(`ServerSocketChannel`), systemd will pass an already accepted fd (`SocketChannel`) representing an individual TCP
connection. systemd will start a new instance of the service for each new TCP connection.

The Micronaut HTTP server supports this mode through the `accepted-fd` config option. An `accepted-fd` will be
registered with the listener it is declared on, and essentially treated like a connection that was accepted by the
listener. The netty parent channel will be set to the listener server socket, which is important to avoid a
https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12546[netty bug] in connection with HTTP/2.

WARNING: Epoll does not support setting the parent channel, so HTTP/2 may not work with `accepted-fd` and epoll.

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  netty:
    listeners:
      systemd:
        accepted-fd: 0 # inetd-style socket activation typically uses fd 0 (stdin)
        bind: false # do not bind, we only use the server channel as the parent
----

By setting `server-socket: false`, you can disable the parent channel entirely. This may save some slight startup time,
but may cause problems with HTTP/2.

WARNING: Because inetd-style socket activation typically uses fd 0, it hijacks stdin and stdout. You must take care to
never emit any output on stdout, as this may corrupt the HTTP response, or even show up for the user. In particular,
you must configure logback to log to `System.err` instead, and disable the Micronaut startup banner.
