Don't define `allowed-origins` or `allowed-origins-regex` to allow any origin for a given configuration.

For multiple valid origins, set the `allowed-origins` key of the configuration to a list of strings.

You can also define via `allowed-origins-regex` a regular expression (`^http(|s)://www\.google\.com$`). The Regular expression is passed to link:{javase}java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile-java.lang.String-[Pattern#compile] and compared to the request origin with link:{javase}java/util/regex/Matcher.html#matches--[Matcher#matches].

          allowed-origins:
            - http://foo.com

WARNING: Use the `allowed-origins-regex` configuration judiciously. You may accidentally make an insecure configuration which could be targeted by an attacker registering domains targeting the regular expression.

NOTE: `allowed-origins-regex` and `allowed-origins` can be combined. However, if using the former and the latter is not set explicitly then `allowed-origins` defaults to _none_ rather than _any_ to avoid unexpected allowed origins.
