When dealing with blocking operations, the Micronaut framework shifts the blocking operations to an unbound, caching I/O thread pool by default. You can configure the I/O thread pool using the api:scheduling.executor.ExecutorConfiguration[] named `io`. For example:

.Configuring the Server I/O Thread Pool
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  executors:
    io:
      type: fixed
      nThreads: 75
----

The above configuration creates a fixed thread pool with 75 threads.
