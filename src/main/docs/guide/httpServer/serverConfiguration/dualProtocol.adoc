Micronaut supports binding both HTTP and HTTPS. To enable dual protocol support, modify your configuration. For example with `application.yml`:

.Dual Protocol Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    build-self-signed: true # <1>
  server:
    dual-protocol : true #<2>
----
<1> You must configure SSL for HTTPS to work. In this example we are just using a self-signed certificate, but see <<https, Securing the Server with HTTPS>> for other configurations
<2> Enabling both HTTP and HTTPS is an opt-in feature - setting the `dualProtocol` flag enables it. By default Micronaut only enables one


It is also possible to redirect automatically all HTTP request to HTTPS. Besides the previous configuration, you need to enable this option. For example, with `application.yml`:

.Enable HTTP to HTTPS Redirects
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    build-self-signed: true
  server:
    dual-protocol : true
    http-to-https-redirect: true # <1>
----
<1> Enable HTTP to HTTPS redirects
