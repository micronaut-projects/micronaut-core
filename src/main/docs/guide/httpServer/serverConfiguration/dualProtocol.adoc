Micronaut supports binding both HTTP and HTTPS. To enable dual protocol support, modify your configuration. For example with `application.yml`:

.Dual Protocol Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    buildSelfSigned: true # <1>
  server:
    dualProtocol : true #<2>
----
<1> You must configure SSL for HTTPS to work. In this example we are just using a self-signed certificate, but see <<https, Securing the Server with HTTPS>> for other configurations
<2> Enabling both HTTP and HTTPS is an opt-in feature - setting the `dualProtocol` flag enables it. By default Micronaut only enables one
