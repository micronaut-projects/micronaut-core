Micronaut supports binding both HTTP and HTTPS out of the box. To enable
dual protocol support, modify your configuration. For example with `application.yml`:

.Dual Protocol Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    ssl:
        enabled: true
        buildSelfSigned: true # <1>
    server:
        dualProtocol : true #<2>
----
<1> You will need to configure ssl for https to work. In this example we are just using self signed but see <<https, Securing the Server with HTTPS>> for other configurations
<2> To enable http & https is an opt-in feature, setting the dualProtocol flag enables that, by default Micronaut will only enable one or the other
