Micronaut supports HTTPS out of the box. By default HTTPS is disabled and all requests are served using HTTP. To enable
HTTPS support, modify your configuration. For example with `application.yml`:

.HTTPS Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    buildSelfSigned: true # <1>
----
<1> Micronaut will create a self-signed certificate.

TIP: By default Micronaut with HTTPS support starts on port `8443` but you can change the port the property
 `micronaut.ssl.port`.

WARNING: Keep in mind that this configuration will generate a warning on the browser.

== Using a valid x509 certificate

It is also possible to configure Micronaut to use an existing valid x509 certificate, for example one created with
https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt]. You will need the `server.crt` and `server.key` files and convert them to a
 PKCS #12 file.

[source,bash]
----
$ openssl pkcs12 -export \
                 -in server.crt \ # <1>
                 -inkey server.key \ # <2>
                 -out server.p12 \ # <3>
                 -name someAlias \ <4>
                 -chain -CAfile ca.crt -caname root
----
<1> The original `server.crt` file
<2> The original `server.key` file
<3> The `server.p12` file that will be created
<4> The alias for the certificate

During the creation of the `server.p12` file it is necessary to define a password that will be required later when using
the certificate in Micronaut.

Now modify your configuration:

.HTTPS Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    keyStore:
      path: classpath:server.p12 # <1>
      password: mypassword # <2>
      type: PKCS12
----
<1> The `p12` file created. It can also be referenced as `file:/path/to/the/file`
<2> The password defined during the export

With this configuration if we start Micronaut and connect to `https://localhost:8443` we still see the warning on the
browser but if we inspect the certificate we can check that it's the one generated by Let's Encrypt.

Finally we can test that the certificate is valid for the browser just by adding an alias to the domain in `/etc/hosts` file:

[source,bash]
----
$ cat /etc/hosts
...
127.0.0.1   my-domain.org
...
----

Now we can connect to `https://my-domain.org:8443`:

== Using Java Keystore (JKS)

It is not recommended using this type of certificate because it is a proprietary format and it's better to use a PKCS12
format. In any case Micronaut also supports it.

Convert the `p12` certificate to a JKS one:

[source,bash]
----
$ keytool -importkeystore \
          -deststorepass newPassword -destkeypass newPassword \ # <1>
          -destkeystore server.keystore \ # <2>
          -srckeystore server.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srcstorepass mypassword \ # <3>
          -alias someAlias # <4>
----
<1> It is necessary to define a the password for the keystore
<2> The file that will be created
<3> The PKCS12 file created before and the password defined during the creation
<4> The alias used before

WARNING: If either `srcstorepass` or `alias` are not the same as defined in the `p12` file, the conversion will fail.

Now modify your configuration:

.HTTPS Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    keyStore:
      path: classpath:server.keystore
      password: newPassword
      type: JKS
----

Start Micronaut and the application is running on `https://localhost:8443` using the certificate in the keystore.
