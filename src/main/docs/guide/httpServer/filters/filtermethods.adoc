A filter method must be declared in a bean annotated with api:http.annotation.ServerFilter[], or api:http.annotation.ClientFilter[] if it should instead intercept requests made by the HTTP client. Each filter method must also be annotated with api:http.annotation.RequestFilter[], to run before the request is processed, or api:http.annotation.ResponseFilter[], to run after the request has completed to process the response.

NOTE: Request filters can be executed before the route is matched if annotated with api:http.server.annotation.PreMatching[]`

A filter method can take various parameters, such as the api:http.HttpRequest[] and the api:http.HttpResponse[] (only for response filters). The return type can be `void` or `null` to continue execution as normal, or an updated api:http.HttpRequest[] (only for request filters) or api:http.HttpResponse[]. The different supported parameter and return types are described in the documentation of api:http.annotation.RequestFilter[] and api:http.annotation.ResponseFilter[].

Request filters can bind the full request body using the api:http.annotation.Body[] annotation. This is useful e.g. to
verify a signed request body.

IMPORTANT: Accessing the full body should be done with care. It forces the body to be fully buffered, even if the
controller supports streaming (e.g. `@Body InputStream` parameter), leading to potential negative performance impact.

IMPORTANT: Body binding is supported by the netty-based HTTP server, but may not be supported by all other HTTP server
backends.

To write asynchronous filters, you can return a reactive publisher.

To put these concepts into practice lets look at an example.

IMPORTANT: Filter methods execute in the event loop by default. If you need to perform blocking operations, you can annotate the filter with api:scheduling.annotation.ExecuteOn[].
