Suppose you wish to trace each request to the "Hello World" example using some external system. This system could be a database or a distributed tracing service, and may require I/O operations.

You should not block the underlying Netty event loop in your filter; instead the filter should proceed with execution once any I/O is complete.

As an example, consider this `TraceService` that performs an I/O operation:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.filters.filtermethods.TraceService[tags="imports,class", indent=0, title="A TraceService Example using Reactive Streams"]

<1> Since this is just an example, the logic does nothing yet

The following code sample shows how to write a filter using filter methods:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.filters.filtermethods.TraceFilter[tags="imports,clazz", indent=0, title="An Example ServerFilter"]

<1> The api:http.annotation.ServerFilter[] annotation defines the URI pattern(s) the filter matches
<2> The previously defined `TraceService` is injected via constructor
<3> The request filter is marked to execute on a separate thread so that the blocking code in `TraceService` does not cause problems
<4> `TraceService` is invoked to trace the request
<5> Finally, a separate response filter method adds a `X-Trace-Enabled` header to the response.

The previous example demonstrates some key concepts such as executing blocking logic in a worker thread before proceeding with the request and modifying the outgoing response.
