Filters can be ordered in one of three ways:

. An api:order.Order[] annotation on the filter method
. Implementing api:order.Ordered[] in the filter class
. An api:order.Order[] annotation on the filter class

Request filters are executed in order from highest precedence (smallest integer value, as defined by `Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE`) to lowest precedence (biggest integer value, as defined by `Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE`). Response filters are executed in reverse order.

Request filter A is executed first, because it has the higher precedence (-100), followed by request filter B with the lower precedence (100). Then the controller is executed. Response filter C is executed first, because it has the lower precedence (100), and finally response filter D with the higher precedence (-100) is executed last.
