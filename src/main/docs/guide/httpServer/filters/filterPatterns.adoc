Filter patterns can be defined on the filter class (in api:http.annotation.Filter[], the api:http.annotation.ServerFilter[] or api:http.annotation.ClientFilter[] annotation), or on the filter method (in the api:http.annotation.RequestFilter[] or api:http.annotation.ResponseFilter[] annotation).

You can use different styles of pattern for path matching by setting `patternStyle`. By default, api:core.util.AntPathMatcher[] is used for path matching. When using Ant, the mapping matches URLs using the following rules:

* ? matches one character
* * matches zero or more characters
* ** matches zero or more subdirectories in a path

|===
|Pattern|Example Matched Paths

|`/**`
|any path

|`customer/j?y`
|customer/joy, customer/jay

|`customer/*/id`
|customer/adam/id, com/amy/id

|`customer/**`
|customer/adam, customer/adam/id, customer/adam/name

|`customer/**/*.html`
|customer/index.html, customer/adam/profile.html, customer/adam/job/description.html
|===

The other option is regular expression based matching. To use regular expressions, set `patternStyle = FilterPatternStyle.REGEX`. The `pattern` attribute is expected to contain a regular expression which will be expected to match the provided URLs exactly (using link:{jdkapi}/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#matches--[Matcher#matches]).

NOTE: Using `FilterPatternStyle.ANT` is preferred as the pattern matching is more performant than using regular expressions. `FilterPatternStyle.REGEX` should be used when your pattern cannot be written properly using Ant.
