Since Micronaut 4.x, Micronaut's Netty-based HTTP server can be configured to support HTTP/3. This support is experimental and may change without notice.

==== Configuring the Server for HTTP/3

Instead of the TCP used for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, HTTP/3 runs on UDP. To expose a HTTP/3 server, you need to define a <<listener, listener>> with the special `QUIC` protocol family:

.Enabling HTTP/3 Support
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  server:
    netty:
      listeners:
        http3Listener:
          family: QUIC
          port: 8443
----

NOTE: that defining this listener will disable the implicit TCP listeners. You can add them manually as described in the <<listener, listener section>>.

Additionally, the netty HTTP/3 codec needs to be present on the classpath:

dependency:netty-incubator-codec-http3[groupId="io.netty.incubator",artifactId="netty-incubator-codec-http3"]
