As mentioned previously, Micronaut is built on Netty which is designed around an Event loop model and non-blocking I/O. Micronaut executes code defined in ann:http.annotation.Controller[] beans in the same thread as the request thread (an Event Loop thread).

This makes it critical that if you do any blocking I/O operations (for example interactions with Hibernate/JPA or JDBC) that you offload those tasks to a separate thread pool that does not block the Event loop.

For example the following configuration configures the I/O thread pool as a fixed thread pool with 75 threads (similar to what a traditional blocking server such as Tomcat uses in the thread-per-request model):

.Configuring the IO thread pool
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  executors:
    io:
      type: fixed
      nThreads: 75
----

To use this thread pool in a ann:http.annotation.Controller[] bean you have a number of options. The simplest is to use the ann:scheduling.annotation.ExecuteOn[] annotation, which can be declared at the type or method level to indicate which configured thread pool to run the method(s) of the controller on:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.http.server.executeon.PersonController[tags="imports,class", indent=0,title="Using @ExecuteOn"]

<1> The ann:scheduling.annotation.ExecuteOn[] annotation is used to execute the operation on the I/O thread pool

The value of the ann:scheduling.annotation.ExecuteOn[] annotation can be any named executor defined under `micronaut.executors`.

TIP: Generally speaking for database operations you want a thread pool configured that matches the maximum number of connections specified in the database connection pool.

An alternative to the ann:scheduling.annotation.ExecuteOn[] annotation is to use the facility provided by the reactive library you have chosen. RxJava for example features a `subscribeOn` method which lets you alter which thread executes user code. For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.http.server.reactive.PersonController[tags="imports,class", indent=0,title="RxJava subscribeOn Example"]

<1> The configured I/O executor service is injected
<2> The RxJava `fromCallable` method wraps the blocking operation
<3> The RxJava `subscribeOn` method schedules the operation on the I/O thread pool
