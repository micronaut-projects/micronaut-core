A Micronaut controller action produces `application/json` by default. However, you can change the `Content-Type` of the response with the `@Produces` annotation or the `produces` member of the HTTP method annotations.

<1> The default content type is JSON
<2> Annotate a controller action with `@Produces` to change the response content type.
<3> Setting the `produces` member of the method annotation also changes the content type.
