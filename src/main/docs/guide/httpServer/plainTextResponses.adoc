Micronaut Framework supports "text/plain" Content-Type as a way of binding to plain text. However, `text/plain` messages are more restrictive about allowed types, compared to Micronaut 3.x. To return plain text responses for answers other than strings, manually call the object `toString()` method.
snippet::io.micronaut.docs.http.server.response.textplain.TextPlainController[tags="classopening,method,classclosing", title="HTTP Response with text/plain Content-Type"]


<1> The Controller endpoint specifies `text/plain` as the Content-Type.
<2> The endpoint returns type `String`, and the implementation converts the data to a string explicitly using the `toString()` method.

NOTE: For Micronaut Framework 3.x any type was allowed. For writing, the object was converted using `toString`, and for reading, the object was converted using `ConversionService`. This is not permitted anymore for Micronaut Framework 4.x, except for some restricted types. Alternatively, set the `micronaut.http.legacy-text-conversion` configuration option to `true` to restore the old – but not recommended – behavior.
