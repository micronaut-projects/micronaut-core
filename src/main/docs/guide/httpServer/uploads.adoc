Handling of file uploads has special treatment in Micronaut. Support is provided for streaming of uploads in a non-blocking manner through streaming uploads or completed uploads.

To receive data from a multipart request, set the `consumes` argument of the method annotation to api:http.MediaType#MULTIPART_FORM_DATA[]. For example:

[source,java]
----
@Post(consumes = MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA)
HttpResponse upload( ... )
----

== Route Arguments

How the files are received by your method is determined by the type of the arguments. Data can be received a chunk at a time or when an upload is completed.

TIP: If the route argument name can't or shouldn't match the name of the part in the request, simply add the api:http.annotation.Part[@Part] annotation to the argument and specify the name that is expected to be in the request.

=== Chunk Data Types

api:io.micronaut.http.multipart.PartData[] is the data type used to represent a chunk of data received in a multipart request. There are methods on the api:io.micronaut.http.multipart.PartData[] interface to convert the data to a `byte[]`, link:{javase}java/io/InputStream.html[InputStream], or a link:{javase}java/nio/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer].

NOTE: Data can only be retrieved from a api:io.micronaut.http.multipart.PartData[] once. The underlying buffer will be released which causes further attempts to fail.

Route arguments of type rs:Publisher[Publisher<PartData>] will be treated as only intended to receive a single file and each chunk of the received file will be sent downstream. If the generic type is something other than api:io.micronaut.http.multipart.PartData[], conversion will be attempted using Micronaut's conversion service. Conversions to `String` and `byte[]` are supported by default.

If requirements dictate you must have knowledge about the metadata of the file being received, a special class called api:http.multipart.StreamingFileUpload[] has been created that is a rs:Publisher[Publisher<PartData>], but also has file information like the content type and file name.

[source,java]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=class, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=upload, indent=4]

}
----

<1> The method is set to consume api:http.MediaType#MULTIPART_FORM_DATA[]
<2> The method parameters match form attribute names. In this case the `file` will match for example an `<input type="file" name="file">`
<3> The api:http.multipart.StreamingFileUpload.transferTo(java.lang.String)[] method is used to transfer the file to the server. The method returns a rs:Publisher[]
<4> The returned rx:Single[] subscribes to the rs:Publisher[] and outputs a response once the upload is complete, without blocking.

=== Whole Data Types

Route arguments that are not publishers will cause the route execution to be delayed until the upload has finished. The received data will attempt to be converted to the requested type. Conversions to a `String` or `byte[]` are supported by default. In addition, the file can be converted to a POJO if a media type codec has been registered that supports the media type of the file. A media type codec is included by default that allows conversion of JSON files to POJOs.

If requirements dictate you must have knowledge about the metadata of the file being received, a special class called api:http.multipart.CompletedFileUpload[] has been created that has methods to retrieve the data of the file, but also has file information like the content type and file name.

[source,java]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=completedImports, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=class, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=completedUpload, indent=4]

}
----

<1> The method is set to consume api:http.MediaType#MULTIPART_FORM_DATA[]
<2> The method parameters match form attribute names. In this case the `file` will match for example an `<input type="file" name="file">`
<3> The `CompletedFileUpload` instance gives access to metadata about the upload as well as access to the file's contents.

== Multiple Uploads

=== Different Names

If a multipart request supplies multiple uploads that each have a different part name, simply create an argument to your route that receives each part. For example:

[source,java]
----
HttpResponse upload(String title, String name)
----

A route method signature like the above will expect 2 different parts with the names "title" and "name".

=== Same Name

To handle receiving multiple parts with the same part name, the argument must be a rs:Publisher[]. When used in one of the following ways, the publisher will emit one item per file found with the specified name. The publisher must accept one of the following types:

* api:http.multipart.StreamingFileUpload[]
* api:http.multipart.CompletedFileUpload[]
* Any POJO assuming a media codec is found that supports the content type
* Another rs:Publisher[] that accepts one of the chunked data types described above

For example:
[source,java]
----
HttpResponse upload(Publisher<StreamingFileUpload> files)
HttpResponse upload(Publisher<CompletedFileUpload> files)
HttpResponse upload(Publisher<MyObject> files)
HttpResponse upload(Publisher<Publisher<PartData>> files)
----

== Whole Body Binding

For the cases where the names of the parts of the request cannot be known ahead of time, or the entire body should be read, a special type can be used to indicate the entire body is desired.

If a route has an argument of type api:io.micronaut.http.server.multipart.MultipartBody[] (not to be confused with the class for the client) annotated with ann:http.annotation.Body[], then each part of the request will be emitted through the argument. A api:io.micronaut.http.server.multipart.MultipartBody[] is a publisher of api:io.micronaut.http.multipart.CompletedPart[] instances.

For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=imports, indent=0]
include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=wholeBodyImports, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=class, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/upload/UploadController.java[tags=wholeBodyUpload, indent=4]

}
