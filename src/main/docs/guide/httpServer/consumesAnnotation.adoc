A Micronaut controller action consumes `application/json` by default. Consuming other content types is supported with the `@Consumes` annotation, or the `consumes` member of any HTTP method annotation.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.consumes.ConsumesController[tags="imports,clazz", indent=0]

<1> By default, a controller action consumes request with `Content-Type` of type `application/json`.
<2> The `@Consumes` annotation takes a `String[]` of supported media types for an incoming request.
<3> Content types can also be specified with the `consumes` member of the method annotation.

=== Customizing Processed Content Types

Normally JSON parsing only happens if the content type is `application/json`. The other api:io.micronaut.http.codec.MediaTypeCodec[] classes behave similarly in that they have predefined content types they can process. To extend the list of media types that a given codec processes, provide configuration that will be stored in api:io.micronaut.http.codec.CodecConfiguration[]:

[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  codec:
    json:
      additionalTypes:
        - text/javascript
        - ...
----

The currently supported configuration prefixes are `json`, `json-stream`, `text`, and `text-stream`.
