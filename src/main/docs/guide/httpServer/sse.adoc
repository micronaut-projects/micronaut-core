The Micronaut HTTP server supports emitting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events[Server Sent Events (SSE)] using the api:http.sse.Event[] API.

To emit events from the server, return a Reactive Streams rs:Publisher[] that emits objects of type api:http.sse.Event[].

The rs:Publisher[] itself could publish events from a background task, via an event system, etc.

Imagine for an example a event stream of news headlines; you may define a data class as follows:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.sse.Headline[tags="class", indent=0,title="Headline"]

To emit news headline events, write a controller that returns a rs:Publisher[] of api:http.sse.Event[] instances using whichever Reactive library you prefer. The example below uses RxJava 2's rx:Flowable[] via the `generate` method:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.sse.HeadlineController[tags="imports,class", indent=0,title="Publishing Server Sent Events from a Controller"]

<1> The controller method returns a rs:Publisher[] of api:http.sse.Event[]
<2> A headline is emitted for each version of Micronaut
<3> The rx:Flowable[] type's `generate` method generates a rs:Publisher[]. The `generate` method accepts an initial value and a lambda that accepts the value and a rx:Emitter[]. Note that this example executes on the same thread as the controller action, but you could use `subscribeOn` or map an existing "hot" rx:Flowable[].
<4> The rx:Emitter[] interface `onNext` method emits objects of type api:http.sse.Event[]. The api:http.sse.Event.of(ET)[] factory method constructs the event.
<5> The rx:Emitter[] interface `onComplete` method indicates when to finish sending server sent events.

NOTE: You typically want to schedule SSE event streams on a separate executor. The previous example uses ann:scheduling.annotation.ExecuteOn[] to execute the stream on the I/O executor.

The above example sends back a response of type `text/event-stream` and for each api:http.sse.Event[] emitted the `Headline` type previously will be converted to JSON resulting in responses such as:

.Server Sent Event Response Output
[source,json]
----
 data: {"title":"Micronaut 1.0 Released","description":"Come and get it"}
 data: {"title":"Micronaut 2.0 Released","description":"Come and get it"}
----

You can use the methods of the api:http.sse.Event[] interface to customize the Server Sent Event data sent back, including associating event ids, comments, retry timeouts, etc.
