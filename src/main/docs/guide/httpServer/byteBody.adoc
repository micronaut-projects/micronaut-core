Micronaut HTTP server version 4.5.0 introduced a new, more advanced API to access the bytes of an incoming request.
When an api:io.micronaut.http.HttpRequest[] implements api:io.micronaut.http.ServerHttpRequest[], the new `byteBody()`
method returns a api:io.micronaut.http.body.ByteBody[] with buffered, reactive and blocking APIs.

When an HTTP request comes in, it starts out with an unparsed and unclaimed stream of bytes as its `byteBody()`. After
all request filters have run, typically an argument binder matching the `@Body` parameter of the controller will
"claim" the `byteBody()` and e.g. parse the JSON. Finally, the body is closed at the end of the request lifecycle,
discarding any data if it has not been claimed by the argument binder.
