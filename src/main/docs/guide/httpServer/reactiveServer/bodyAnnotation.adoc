To parse the request body, you first indicate to Micronaut which parameter receives the data with the api:http.annotation.Body[] annotation.

The following example implements a simple echo server that echoes the body sent in the request:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.body.MessageController[tags="imports,class,echo,endclass", indent=0, title="Using the @Body annotation"]

<1> The api:io.micronaut.http.annotation.Post[] annotation is used with a api:http.MediaType[] of `text/plain` (the default is `application/json`).
<2> The api:http.annotation.Body[] annotation is used with a `javax.validation.constraints.Size` that limits the size of the body to at most 1MB. This constraint does *not* limit the amount of data read/buffered by the server.
<3> The body is returned as the result of the method

Note that reading the request body is done in a non-blocking manner in that the request contents are read as the data becomes available and accumulated into the String passed to the method.

TIP: The `micronaut.server.maxRequestSize` setting in `application.yml` limits the size of the data (the default maximum request size is 10MB) read/buffered by the server. `@Size` is *not* a replacement for this setting.

Regardless of the limit, for a large amount of data accumulating the data into a String in-memory may lead to memory strain on the server. A better approach is to include a Reactive library in your project (such as `Reactor`, `RxJava`,or `Akka`) that supports the Reactive streams implementation and stream the data it becomes available:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.body.MessageController[tags="imports,importsreactive,class,echoReactive,endclass", indent=0, title="Using Reactive Streams to Read the request body"]

<1> In this case the method is altered to receive and return an `Publisher` type.
<2> This example uses https://projectreactor.io[Project Reactor] and returns a single item. Because of that the response type is annotated also with api:core.async.annotation.SingleResult[]. Micronaut only emits the response once the operation completes without blocking.
<3> The `collect` method is used to accumulate the data in this simulated example, but it could for example write the data to a logging service, database, etc. chunk by chunk

IMPORTANT: Body arguments of types that do not require conversion cause Micronaut to skip decoding of the request!
