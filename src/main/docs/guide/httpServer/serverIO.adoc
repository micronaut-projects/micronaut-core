=== Reactively Writing Response Data

Micronaut's HTTP server supports writing chunks of response data by returning a rs:Publisher[] that emits objects that can be encoded to the HTTP response.

The following table summarizes example return type signatures and the behaviour the server exhibits to handle them:

|===
|Return Type | Description

|`Flowable<byte[]>`
|A rx:Flowable[] that emits each chunk of content as a `byte[]` without blocking

|`Flux<ByteBuf>`
|A Reactor `Flux` that emits each chunk as a Netty `ByteBuf`

|`Publisher<String>`
|A rs:Publisher[] that emits each chunk of content as a String

|`Flowable<Book>`
|When emitting a POJO, each emitted object is encoded as JSON by default without blocking

|===

When returning a reactive type, the server uses a `Transfer-Encoding` of `chunked` and keeps writing data until the rs:Publisher[] `onComplete` method is called.

The server requests a single item from the rs:Publisher[], writes it, and requests the next, controlling back pressure.

NOTE: It is up to the implementation of the rs:Publisher[] to schedule any blocking I/O work that may be done as a result of subscribing to the publisher.

=== Performing Blocking I/O

In some cases you may wish to integrate a library that does not support non-blocking I/O.

In this case you can return a api:core.io.Writable[] object from any controller method. The api:core.io.Writable[] interface has various signatures that allow writing to traditional blocking streams like jdk:java.io.Writer[] or jdk:java.io.OutputStream[].

When returning a api:core.io.Writable[], the blocking I/O operation is shifted to the I/O thread pool so the Netty event loop is not blocked.

TIP: See the section on configuring <<threadPools, Server Thread Pools>> for details on how to configure the I/O thread pool to meet your application requirements.

The following example demonstrates how to use this API with Groovy's `SimpleTemplateEngine` to write a server side template:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.writable.TemplateController[tags="imports,clazz", indent=0, title="Performing Blocking I/O"]

<1> The controller creates a simple template
<2> The controller method returns a api:core.io.Writable[]
<3> The returned function receives a jdk:java.io.Writer[] and calls `writeTo` on the template.

=== 404 Responses

Often, you want to respond 404 (Not Found) when you don't find an item in your persistence layer or in similar scenarios.

See the following example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.respondingnotfound.BooksController[tags="clazz", indent=0]

<1> Returning `null` triggers a 404 (Not Found) response.
<2> Returning an empty `Maybe` triggers a 404 (Not Found) response.

NOTE: Responding with an empty `Publisher` or `Flowable` results in an empty array being returned if the content type is JSON.
