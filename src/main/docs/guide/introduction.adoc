The Micronaut Framework is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin, and Groovy.

The Micronaut framework was originally created by a team who had also worked on the Grails framework. The Micronaut framework takes inspiration from lessons learned over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and the Grails framework. The core team continues to develop and maintain the Micronaut project through the support of the Micronaut Foundation.

The Micronaut framework aims to provide all the tools necessary to build JVM applications including:

* Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)
* Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
* Sensible Defaults and Auto-Configuration

With the Micronaut framework you can build Message-Driven Applications, Command Line Applications, HTTP Servers and more whilst for Microservices in particular Micronaut also provides:

* Distributed Configuration
* Service Discovery
* HTTP Routing
* Client-Side Load Balancing

At the same time, the Micronaut framework aims to avoid the downsides of frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot and Grails by providing:

* Fast startup time
* Reduced memory footprint
* Minimal use of reflection
* Minimal use of proxies
* No runtime bytecode generation
* Easy Unit Testing

Historically, frameworks such as Spring and Grails were not designed to run in scenarios such as serverless functions, Android apps, or low memory footprint microservices. In contrast, the Micronaut framework is designed to be suitable for all of these scenarios.

This goal is achieved through the use of Java's link:{jdkapi}/java.compiler/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html[annotation processors], which are usable on any JVM language that supports them, as well as an HTTP Server (with several runtimes https://netty.io/[Netty], link:{micronautservletdocs}#jetty[Jetty], link:{micronautservletdocs}#tomcat[Tomcat], link:{micronautservletdocs}#undertow[Undertow]...) and an HTTP Client (with several runtimes <<nettyHttpClient, Netty>>, <<jdkHttpClient, Java HTTP Client>>, ...). To provide a similar programming model to Spring and Grails, these annotation processors precompile the necessary metadata to perform DI, define AOP proxies and configure your application to run in a low-memory environment.

Many APIs in the Micronaut framework are heavily inspired by Spring and Grails. This is by design, and helps bring developers up to speed quickly.
