Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language.

Micronaut is developed by the creators of the Grails framework and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.

Micronaut aims to provide all the tools necessary to build JVM applications including:

* Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (IoC)
* Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
* Sensible Defaults and Auto-Configuration

With Micronaut you can build Message-Driven Applications, Command Line Applications, HTTP Servers and more whilst for Microservices in particular Micronaut also provides:

* Distributed Configuration
* Service Discovery
* HTTP Routing
* Client-Side Load Balancing

At the same time Micronaut aims to avoid the downsides of frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot and Grails by providing:

* Fast startup time
* Reduced memory footprint
* Minimal use of reflection
* Minimal use of proxies
* No runtime bytecode generation
* Easy Unit Testing

Historically, frameworks such as Spring and Grails were not designed to run in scenarios such as server-less functions, Android apps, or low memory-footprint microservices. In contrast, Micronaut is designed to be suitable for all of these scenarios.

This goal is achieved through the use of Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html[annotation processors], which are usable on any JVM language that supports them, as well as an HTTP Server and Client built on https://netty.io/[Netty]. In order to provide a similar programming model to Spring and Grails, these annotation processors precompile the necessary metadata in order to perform DI, define AOP proxies and configure your application to run in a low-memory environment.

Many of the APIs within Micronaut are heavily inspired by Spring and Grails. This is by design, and aids in bringing developers up to speed quickly.
