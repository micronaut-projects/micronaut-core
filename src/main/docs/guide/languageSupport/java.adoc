For Java, Micronaut uses a Java api:annotation.processing.BeanDefinitionInjectProcessor[] annotation processor to process classes at compile time and produce api:inject.BeanDefinition[] classes.

The major advantage here is that you pay a slight cost at compile time, but at runtime Micronaut is largely reflection-free, fast and consumes very little memory.
