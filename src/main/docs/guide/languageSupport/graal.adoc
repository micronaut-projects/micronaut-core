https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM] is a new universal virtual machine from Oracle that supports a polyglot runtime environment and the ability to compile Java applications to native machine code.

Any Micronaut application can be run using the GraalVM JVM, however special support has been added to Micronaut to support running Micronaut applications using https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/[GraalVM's `native-image` tool].

Micronaut currently supports GraalVM version {graalVersion} and the team is improving the support in every new release. Don't hesitate to https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues[report issues] however if you find any problem.

Many of Micronaut's modules and third-party libraries have been verified to work with GraalVM: HTTP server, HTTP client, Function support, Micronaut Data JDBC and JPA, Service Discovery, RabbitMQ, Views, Security, Zipkin, etc. Support for other modules is evolving and will improve over time.

=== Getting Started

NOTE: Use of GraalVM's `native-image` tool is only supported in Java or Kotlin projects. Groovy relies heavily on reflection which is only partially supported by GraalVM.

To start using GraalVM, first install the GraalVM SDK via the https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/[Getting Started]  instructions or using https://sdkman.io/[Sdkman!].
