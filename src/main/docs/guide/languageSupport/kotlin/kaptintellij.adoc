As of this writing IntelliJ's built-in compiler does not directly support Kapt and annotation processing. You must instead configure Intellij to run Gradle (or Maven) compilation as a build step before running your tests or application class.

First edit the run configuration for tests or for the application and select "Run Gradle task" as a build step:

Then add the `classes` task as task to execute for the application or for tests the `testClasses` task:

Now whenever you run tests or the application Micronaut classes will be generated at compilation time.

Alternatively, you can https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html#delegate_build_gradle[delegate IntelliJ build/run actions to Gradle] completely:
