Micronaut framework has offered support for Kotlin via https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html[Kapt].

With version 4.0, Micronaut framework supports Kotlin also via https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html[Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) API].

Please note that KAPT is in maintenance mode. Micronaut framework 4 includes experimental support for KSP which Kotlin users should consider migrating in the future.

____
kapt is in maintenance mode. We are keeping it up-to-date with recent Kotlin and Java releases but have no plans to implement new features.
____

KAPT supports existing Java annotation processors by generating Java stubs and feeding them into the Java annotation processors.

By skipping the generation of stubs, KSP offers several advantages:

* Faster compilation.
* Better support Kotlin native syntax.

WARNING: If you use other annotation processors besides the Micronaut annotation processors, they will not work with KSP.
