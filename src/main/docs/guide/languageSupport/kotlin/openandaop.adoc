Micronaut provides a compile-time AOP API that does not use reflection. When you use any Micronaut <<aop, AOP Advice>>, it creates a subclass at compile-time to provide the AOP behaviour. This can be a problem because Kotlin classes are final by default. If the application was created with the Micronaut CLI, the Kotlin link:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#all-open-compiler-plugin[all-open] plugin is configured for you to automatically change your classes to `open` when an AOP annotation is used. To configure it yourself, add the api:io.micronaut.aop.Around[] class to the list of supported annotations.

If you prefer not to or cannot use the `all-open` plugin, you must declare the classes that are annotated with an AOP annotation to be open:

[source, java]
----
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get
import io.micronaut.http.HttpStatus
import io.micronaut.validation.Validated
import javax.validation.constraints.NotBlank

@Validated
@Controller("/email")
open class EmailController { // <1>

    @Get("/send")
    fun index(@NotBlank recipient: String, // <1>
              @NotBlank subject: String): HttpStatus {
        return HttpStatus.OK
    }
}
----

<1> if you use `@Validated` AOP Advice, you need to use `open` at class and method level.

NOTE: The `all-open` plugin does not handle methods. If you declare an AOP annotation on a method, you must manually declare it as open.
