Kotlin coroutines allow you to create asynchronous applications with imperative style code. A Micronaut's controller
action can be a `suspend` function:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.suspend.SuspendController[tags="suspend", indent=0, title="Controller suspend function example"]

<1> The function is marked as `suspend`, though in reality it won't be suspended.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.suspend.SuspendController[tags="suspendDelayed", indent=0, title="Controller suspend function example"]

<1> The function is marked as `suspend`.
<2> The `delay` is called to make sure that a function is suspended and the response is returned from a different thread.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.suspend.SuspendController[tags="suspendStatus", indent=0, title="Controller suspend function example"]

<1> `suspend` function also works when all we want is to return a status.

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.suspend.SuspendController[tags="suspendStatusDelayed", indent=0, title="Controller suspend function example"]

You can also use `Flow` type for streaming server and client. A streaming controller can return `Flow`, for example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.streaming.HeadlineFlowController[tags="streamingWithFlow", indent=0, title="Streaming JSON on the Server with Flow"]

<1> A method `streamHeadlinesWithFlow` is defined that produces `application/x-json-stream`
<2> A `Flow` is created using `flow`
<3> This `Flow` will emit 100 messages
<4> Emitting will happend with `emit` `suspend` function
<5> There will be a 1 second _delay_ between messages

A streaming client can simply return a `Flow`, for example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.streaming.HeadlineFlowClient[tags="imports, class, streamingWithFlow", indent=0, title="Streaming client with Flow"]

<1> The `@Get` method is defined as processing responses of type `APPLICATION_JSON_STREAM`
<2> A `Flow` is used as the return type
