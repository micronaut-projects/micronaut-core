=== Getting Started with Micronaut and Graal

To get started creating a Microservice that can be compiled into a native image, use the `graal-native-image` feature when creating the application with the CLI:

.Creating a Graal Native Microservice
[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-app hello-world --features graal-native-image
----
NOTE: For Kotlin use `graal-native-image-kotlin` feature.

The `graal-native-image` feature adds three important items:

1. The `svm` and `graal` dependencies to your `build.gradle` (or `pom.xml` if `--build maven` is used).
2. A `Dockerfile` which can be used to construct the native image using Docker and a script `docker-build.sh` to run it.
3. A `native-image.properties` configuration file `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image` to simplify building the image.

The `native-image.properties` file that is generated looks something like:

[source,properties]
----
Args = -H:IncludeResources=logback.xml|application.yml|bootstrap.yml \ # <1>
       -H:Name=example \ # <2>
       -H:Class=example.Application # <3>
----

<1> The `-H:IncludeResources` argument allows you to tweak which static resources to include.
<2> The `-H:Name` argument specifies the name of the native image that will be generated.
<3> The `-H:Class` argument specifies the entry point of your application (the class that defines a `static void main` method.

==== Building a Native Image Using Docker

To build your native image using Docker simply run:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble # or ./mvnw package if using Maven
$ docker build . -t hello-world
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 hello-world
----

Or use the provided script:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble # or ./mvnw package if using Maven
$ ./docker-build.sh
----

The provided `Dockerfile` is a multi-stage dockerfile which builds the project in two steps:

1. A GraalVM official image will build the native image.
2. A typical dockerfile structure will build the final image which in smaller due to layering.


==== Building a Native Image Without Using Docker

To build your native image without using Docker you need to install GraalVM SDK via the https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/[Getting Started] instructions or using SDKman:

.Installing GraalVM 19.3.1 with SDKman
[source,bash]
----
$ sdk install java 19.3.1.r8-grl # or 19.3.1.r11-grl if you want to use JDK 11
$ sdk use java 19.3.1.r8-grl
----

The `native-image` tool was extracted from the base GraalVM distribution. Currently it is available as an early adopter plugin. To install it, run:

.Installing `native-image` tool
[source,bash]
----
$ gu install native-image
----


.Creating native image with Gradle
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
$ native-image --no-server -cp build/libs/hello-world-0.1-all.jar
----

.Creating native image with Maven
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw package
$ native-image --no-server -cp target/hello-world-0.1-all.jar
----

.Run native image
[source,bash]
----
$ ./hello-world
----


=== Understanding Micronaut and Graal

Micronaut itself does not rely on reflection or dynamic classloading so works automatically with GraalVM native, however certain third party libraries used by Micronaut may require additional input about uses of reflection.

Micronaut includes an annotation processor that helps to handle generating the `reflection-config.json` metadata that is automatically picked up by the `native-image` tool:

dependency:micronaut-graal[scope="annotationProcessor"]

This processor will generate a `reflection-config.json` file to a file to the `META-INF/native-image` directory in your build classes directory (`target/classes` with Maven and typically `build/classes/java/main` with Gradle) and a `native-image.properties` file to read this configuration for all classes annotated with either ann:core.annotation.Introspected[] or ann:core.annotation.TypeHint[].

For example the following class:

[source,java]
----
package example;
import io.micronaut.core.annotation.*;

@Introspected
class Test {
    ...
}
----

The above example will result in the public methods and declared constructors of `example.Test` being included in `reflection-config.json`.

If you have more advanced requirements and only wish to include certain fields or methods, you can use ann:core.annotation.ReflectiveAccess[] instead which can be present on any constructor, field or method to include only the specific field, constructor or method.

TIP: If you wish to provide your own `reflect.json` you can add one to `src/main/graal/reflect.json` and it will be automatically picked up.


=== Adding Additional Classes for Reflective Access

To inform Micronaut of additional classes that should be included in the generated `reflect.json` file at compilation time you can either annotate a class with ann:core.annotation.Introspected[] or ann:core.annotation.TypeHint[].

The former will generate a compile time introspection as well as allowing reflective access and the latter will only allow reflective access and is typically used on a module or `Application` class to include classes that are needed reflectively. For example, the following is taken from Micronaut's Jackson module:

[source,java]
----
@TypeHint(
        value = { // <1>
                PropertyNamingStrategy.UpperCamelCaseStrategy.class,
                ArrayList.class,
                LinkedHashMap.class,
                HashSet.class
        },
        accessType = TypeHint.AccessType.ALL_DECLARED_CONSTRUCTORS // <2>
)
----

<1> The `value` member is used to specify which classes require reflection.
<2> The `accessType` member specifies if only classloading access is needed or whether full reflection on all public members is needed.

=== Generating Native Images

GraalVM's `native-image` command is used to generate native images. You can use this command manually to generate your native image. An example can be seen below.

.The `native-image` command
[source,bash]
----
native-image --no-server \ # <1>
             --class-path build/libs/hello-world-0.1-all.jar # <2>
----
<1> Do not start a background server to generate the native image
<2> The `class-path` argument is used to refer to the Micronaut shaded JAR

Once the image has been built you can run the application using the native image name:

.Running the Native Application
[source,bash]
----
$ ./hello-world
15:15:15.153 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 14ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080
----

As you can see the advantage of having a native image is startup completes in milliseconds and memory consumption does not include the overhead of the JVM (a native Micronaut application runs with just 20mb of memory).
