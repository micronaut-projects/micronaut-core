==== How does Micronaut manage to run on GraalVM?

Micronaut features a Dependency Injection and Aspect-Oriented Programming runtime that uses no reflection. This makes it easier for Micronaut applications to run on GraalVM since there are https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/LIMITATIONS.md[limitations] particularly around https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/REFLECTION.md[reflection] on SubstrateVM.

==== How can I make a Micronaut application that uses picocli run on GraalVM?

Picocli provides a `picocli-codegen` module with a tool for generating a GraalVM reflection configuration file. The tool can be run https://picocli.info/picocli-on-graalvm.html[manually] or automatically as part of the build. The module's https://github.com/remkop/picocli/tree/master/picocli-codegen[README] has usage instructions with code snippets for configuring Gradle and Maven to generate a `cli-reflect.json` file automatically as part of the build. Add the generated file to the `-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles` option when running the `native-image` tool.

==== What about other Third-Party Libraries?

Micronaut cannot guarantee that third-party libraries work on GraalVM SubstrateVM, that is down to each individual library to implement support.

==== I Get a "Class XXX is instantiated reflectively..." Exception. What do I do?

If you get an error such as:

----
Class myclass.Foo[] is instantiated reflectively but was never registered. Register the class by using org.graalvm.nativeimage.RuntimeReflection
----

You may need to manually tweak the generated `reflect.json` file. For regular classes you need to add an entry into the array:

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "name" : "myclass.Foo",
        "allDeclaredConstructors" : true
    },
    ...
]
----

For arrays this must use the Java JVM internal array representation. For example:

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "name" : "[Lmyclass.Foo;",
        "allDeclaredConstructors" : true
    },
    ...
]
----

==== What if I want to set the heap's maximum size with `-Xmx`, but I get an `OutOfMemoryError`?

If you set the maximum heap size in the Dockerfile that you use to build your native image, you will probably get a runtime error like this:

----
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory
----

The problem is that Netty tries to allocate 16MB of memory per chunk with its default settings for `io.netty.allocator.pageSize` and `io.netty.allocator.maxOrder`:

[source, java]
----
int defaultChunkSize = DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE << DEFAULT_MAX_ORDER; // 8192 << 11 = 16MB
----

The simplest solution is to specify `io.netty.allocator.maxOrder` explicitly in your Dockerfile's entrypoint. A working example with `-Xmx64m`:

[source, dockerfile]
----
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/application", "-Xmx64m", "-Dio.netty.allocator.maxOrder=8"]
----

To go further, you can also experiment with `io.netty.allocator.numHeapArenas` or `io.netty.allocator.numDirectArenas`. You can find more information about Netty's `PooledByteBufAllocator` in the https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/buffer/PooledByteBufAllocator.html[official documentation].
