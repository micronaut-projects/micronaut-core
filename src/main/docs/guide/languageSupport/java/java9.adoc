Micronaut is built with Java 8 but works fine with Java 9 and above. The classes that Micronaut generates sit alongside existing classes in the same package, hence do not violate anything regarding the Java module system.

There are some considerations when using Java 9+ with Micronaut.

=== The javax.annotation package

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you create your project using the Micronaut CLI, the `javax.annotation` dependency is added to your project automatically if you use Java 9+.
====

The `javax.annotation`, which includes `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy`, etc. has been moved from the core JDK to a module. In general annotations in this package should be avoided and instead the `jakarta.annotation` equivalents used.
