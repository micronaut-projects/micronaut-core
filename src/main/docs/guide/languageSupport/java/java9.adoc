Micronaut is built with Java 8 but works fine with Java 9 and above. The classes that Micronaut generates sit alongside existing classes in the same package, hence do not violate anything regarding the Java module system.

====

The `javax.annotation`, which includes `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy`, etc. has been moved from the core JDK to a module. If you run under Java 9+, import the module or add the dependency to your build:
