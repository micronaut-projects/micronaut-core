You can use any IDE to develop Micronaut applications, if you depend on your configured build tool (Gradle or Maven) to build the application.

However, if you wish to run tests within the IDE that is currently possible with http://jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ IDEA] or Eclipse 4.9 M2 or above.

See the section on <<ideSetup, IDE Setup>> in the Quick start for more information on how to configure IntelliJ or Eclipse.
