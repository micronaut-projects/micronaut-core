You can use any IDE to develop Micronaut applications, if you depend on your configured build tool (Gradle or Maven) to build the application.

However, running tests within the IDE is currently possible with https://jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ IDEA] or Eclipse 4.9 or higher.

See the section on <<ideSetup, IDE Setup>> in the Quick start for more information on how to configure IntelliJ and Eclipse.
