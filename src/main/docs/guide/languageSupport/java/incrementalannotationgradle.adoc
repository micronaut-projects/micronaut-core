Micronaut supports https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:incremental_annotation_processing[Gradle incremental annotation processing] which speeds up builds by compiling only classes that have changed, avoiding a full recompilation.

However, the support is disabled by default since Micronaut allows the definition of custom meta-annotations (to for example define <<aop,custom AOP advice>>) that need to be configured for processing.

The following example demonstrates how to enable and configure incremental annotation processing for annotations you have defined under the `com.example` package:

.Enabling Incremental Annotation Processing
[source,groovy]
----
tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.compilerArgs = [
        '-Amicronaut.processing.incremental=true',
        '-Amicronaut.processing.annotations=com.example.*',
    ]
}
----

WARNING: If you do not enable processing for your custom annotations, they will be ignored by Micronaut, which may break your application.
