Micronaut can be set up within Visual Studio Code. First install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack[Java Extension Pack].

TIP: You can also optionally install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-spring-boot[STS] to enable code completion for `application.yml`.

If you use Gradle, prior to opening the project in VSC run the following command from a terminal window:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew eclipse
----

Once the extension pack is installed and if you have setup https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac[terminal integration] just type `code .` in any project directory and the project will be automatically setup.
