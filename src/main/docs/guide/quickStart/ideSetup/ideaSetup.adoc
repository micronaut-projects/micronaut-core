To import a Micronaut project into IntelliJ IDEA, open the `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` file and follow the instructions to import the project.

For IntelliJ IDEA, if you plan to use the IntelliJ compiler, enable annotation processing under "Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors" by ticking the "Enable annotation processing" checkbox:

Once you have enabled annotation processing in IntelliJ you can run the application and tests directly within the IDE without the need of an external build tool such as Gradle or Maven.
