As mentioned previously, Micronaut includes both an <<httpServer,HTTP server>> and an <<httpClient,HTTP client>>. A <<lowLevelHttpClient,low-level HTTP client>> is provided out of the box which you can use to test the `HelloController` created in the previous section.

For example, the following test is written using http://spockframework.org[Spock Framework]:

.Testing Hello World
[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/intro/HelloControllerSpec.groovy[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/intro/HelloControllerSpec.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]
----

<1> The api:runtime.server.EmbeddedServer[] is configured as a shared and automatically cleaned up test field
<2> A api:http.client.HttpClient[] instance shared field is also defined
<3> The test using the `toBlocking()` method to make a blocking call
<4> The `retrieve` method returns the response of the controller as a `String`


In addition to a low-level client, Micronaut features a <<clientAnnotation,declarative, compile-time HTTP client>>, powered by the api:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation.

To create a client, simply create an interface annotated with `@Client`. For example:


.src/main/java/hello/world/HelloClient.java
[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/intro/HelloClient.java[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/intro/HelloClient.java[tags=class, indent=0]
----

<1> The `@Client` annotation is used with value that is a relative path to the current server
<2> The same link:{api}/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get] annotation used on the server is used to define the client mapping
<3> A RxJava rx:Single[] is returned with the value read from the server

To test the `HelloClient` simply retrieve it from the api:context.ApplicationContext[] associated with the server:

.Testing HelloClient
[source,groovy]
----
include::{testsuite}/server/intro/HelloClientSpec.groovy[tags=imports, indent=0]

include::{testsuite}/server/intro/HelloClientSpec.groovy[tags=class, indent=0]
----

<1> The api:runtime.server.EmbeddedServer[] is run
<2> The `HelloClient` is retrieved from the api:context.ApplicationContext[]
<3> The client is invoked using RxJava's `blockingGet` method

The api:http.client.Client[] annotation produces an implementation automatically for you at compile time without the need to use proxies or runtime reflection.

The api:http.client.Client[] annotation is very flexible. See the section on the <<httpClient, Micronaut HTTP Client>> for more information.
