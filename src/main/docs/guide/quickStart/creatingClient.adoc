As mentioned previously, Micronaut includes both an <<httpServer,HTTP server>> and an <<httpClient,HTTP client>>. A <<lowLevelHttpClient,low-level HTTP client>> is provided which you can use to test the `HelloController` created in the previous section.

.Testing Hello World

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.intro.HelloControllerSpec[tags="imports,class",indent=0]

<1> The api:runtime.server.EmbeddedServer[] is configured as a shared test field
<2> A api:http.client.HttpClient[] instance shared field is also defined
<3> The test uses the `toBlocking()` method to make a blocking call
<4> The `retrieve` method returns the controller response as a `String`

In addition to a low-level client, Micronaut features a <<clientAnnotation,declarative, compile-time HTTP client>>, powered by the api:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation.

To create a client, create an interface annotated with `@Client`, for example:

.src/main/java/hello/world/HelloClient.java

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.intro.HelloClient[tags="imports,class",indent=0]

<1> The `@Client` annotation is used with a value that is a relative path to the current server
<2> The same ann:http.annotation.Get[] annotation used on the server is used to define the client mapping
<3> An RxJava rx:Single[] is returned with the value read from the server

To test the `HelloClient`, retrieve it from the api:context.ApplicationContext[] associated with the server:

.Testing HelloClient

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.intro.HelloClientSpec[tags="imports,class",indent=0]

<1> The `@MicronautTest` annotation defines the test
<2> The `HelloClient` is injected from the api:context.ApplicationContext[]
<3> The client is invoked using the RxJava `blockingGet` method

The api:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation produces an implementation automatically for you at compile time without the using proxies or runtime reflection.

The api:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation is very flexible. See the section on the <<httpClient, Micronaut HTTP Client>> for more information.
