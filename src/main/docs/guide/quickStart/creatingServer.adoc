Although not required to use Micronaut, the Micronaut CLI is the quickest way to create a new server application.

Using the CLI you can create a new Micronaut application in either Groovy, Java or Kotlin (the default is Java).

The following command creates a new "Hello World" server application in Java with a Gradle build:

[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-app hello-world
----

TIP: You can supply `--build maven` if you wish to create a Maven based build instead

The previous command will create a new Java application in a directory called `hello-world` featuring a Gradle build. The application can be run with `./gradlew run`:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew run
> Task :run
[main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 972ms. Server Running: http://localhost:28933
----

If you have created a Maven based project, use `./mvnw compile exec:exec` instead.

NOTE: For Windows the ./ before commands is not needed

By default the Micronaut HTTP server is configured to run on port 8080. See the section <<runningSpecificPort, Running Server on a Specific Port>> in the user guide for more options.

In order to create a service that responds to "Hello World" you first need a controller. The following is an example of a controller:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.intro.HelloController[tags="imports,class"]

<1> The class is defined as a controller with the link:{api}/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Controller.html[@Controller] annotation mapped to the path `/hello`
<2> The link:{api}/io/micronaut/http/annotation/Get.html[@Get] annotation is used to map the `index` method to all requests that use an HTTP `GET`
<3> A String "Hello World" is returned as the result

[%hardbreaks]
If you are using Java, place the previous file in `src/main/java/hello/world`.
If you are using Groovy, place the previous file in `src/main/groovy/hello/world`.
If you are using Kotlin, place the previous file in `src/main/kotlin/hello/world`.

If you start the application and send a request to the `/hello` URI then the text "Hello World" is returned:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
Hello World
----
