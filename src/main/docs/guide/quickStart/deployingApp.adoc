To deploy a Micronaut application you create a runnable JAR file by running `./gradlew assembleShadowDist` or `./mvnw package`.

The constructed JAR file can then be executed with `java -jar`. For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar build/libs/hello-world-all.jar
----

The runnable JAR can also easily be packaged within a Docker container or deployed to any Cloud infrastructure that supports runnable JAR  files.
