To deploy to https://cloud.google.com/run[Google Cloud Run] we recommend using https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[JIB] to containerize your application.

[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
Creating an application with JIB:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features jib
----
Or with Micronaut Launch
----
$ curl https://launch.micronaut.io/example.zip\?features\=jib -o example.zip
$ unzip example.zip -d example
----
====

With JIB setup to deploy your application to Google Container Registry you can simple run:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew jib
----

You are now ready to deploy your application :

[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/[PROJECT ID]/example --platform=managed --allow-unauthenticated
----

Where `[PROJECT ID]` is replaced for your project ID. You should be asked to specify a region and see output like the following:

[source]
----
Service name: (example):
Deploying container to Cloud Run service [example] in project [PROJECT_ID] region [us-central1]

✓ Deploying... Done.

Service [example] revision [example-00004] has been deployed and is serving 100 percent of traffic at https://example-9487r97234-uc.a.run.app
----

The URL is the URL of your Cloud Run application.
