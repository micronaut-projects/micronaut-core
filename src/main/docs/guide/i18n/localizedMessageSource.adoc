api:context.LocalizedMessageSource[] is a `@RequestScope` bean which you can inject in your Controllers and which uses <<localeResolution, Micronaut Locale Resolution>> to resolve the localized message for the current HTTP request.

TIP: See the guide for https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/localized-message-source.html[Localize your Application] to learn more.
