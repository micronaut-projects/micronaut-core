Multi-Tenancy, as it relates to software development, is when a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in a way that each tenant's data is isolated from the other.

To use the Micronaut's multitenancy capabilities you must have the `multitenancy` dependency on your classpath.

dependency:micronaut-multitenancy[]

A common requirement for supporting Multi-tenancy is the ability to resolve the current tenant. Micronaut ships with the following built-in api:multitenancy.tenantresolver.TenantResolver[]s:

|===
| name|description
| api:multitenancy.tenantresolver.CookieTenantResolver[]
| Resolves the current tenant from an HTTP cookie. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.tenantresolver.CookieTenantResolverConfigurationProperties[CookieTenantResolver Configuration Properties].
| api:multitenancy.tenantresolver.FixedTenantResolver[]
| Resolves against a fixed tenant id. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.tenantresolver.FixedTenantResolverConfigurationProperties[FixTenantResolver Configuration Properties].
| api:multitenancy.tenantresolver.HttpHeaderTenantResolver[]
| Resolves the current tenant from the request HTTP Header. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.tenantresolver.HttpHeaderTenantResolverConfigurationProperties[FixTenantResolver Configuration Properties].
| api:multitenancy.tenantresolver.PrincipalTenantResolver[]
| Resolves the current tenant from the authenticated username. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.tenantresolver.PrincipalTenantResolverConfigurationProperties[PrincipalTenantResolver Configuration Properties].
| api:multitenancy.tenantresolver.SessionTenantResolver[]
| Resolves the current tenant from the HTTP session. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.tenantresolver.SessionTenantResolverConfigurationProperties[SessionTenantResolver Configuration Properties].
| api:multitenancy.tenantresolver.SubdomainTenantResolver[]
| Resolves the tenant id from the subdomain. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.tenantresolver.SubdomainTenantResolverConfigurationProperties[SubdomainTenantResolver Configuration Properties].
| api:multitenancy.tenantresolver.SystemPropertyTenantResolver[]
| Resolves the tenant id from a system property. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.tenantresolver.SystemPropertyTenantResolverConfigurationProperties[SystemPropertyTenantResolver Configuration Properties].
|===

Micronaut supports tenant propagation. As an example, take the following scenario:

image:multitenancy.svg[]

You want incoming requests to the `gateway` microservice to resolve the tenant id via subdomain. However, you want
your requests to other internal microservices to include the `tenant Id` as an HTTP Header.

Your configuration in the `gateway` microservice will look like:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testsmultitenancy}/TenantPropagationSpec.groovy[tag=gatewayConfig,indent=0]
----

In the `catalogue` microservice the configuration will look like:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{testsmultitenancy}/TenantPropagationSpec.groovy[tag=catalogueConfig,indent=0]
----

To propagate the tenant you will need to write the resolved tenant ID to the outgoing requests.

Currently, Micronaut ships with two built-in implementations for api:multitenancy.writer.TenantWriter[]:

|===
| name|description
| api:multitenancy.writer.CookieTenantWriter[]
| Writes the current tenant to a Cookie in your outgoing requests. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.writer.CookieTenantWriterConfigurationProperties[CookieTenantWriter Configuration Properties].
| api:multitenancy.writer.HttpHeaderTenantWriter[]
| Writes the current tenant to a HTTP Header. See link:configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.multitenancy.writer.HttpHeaderTenantWriterConfigurationProperties[HttpHeaderTenantWriter Configuration Properties].
