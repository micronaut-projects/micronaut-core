To use an implementation based on https://openjdk.org/groups/net/httpclient/intro.html[Java HTTP Client], add the following dependency to your build:

dependency:micronaut-http-client-jdk[]

NOTE: This implementation of the Micronaut HTTP Client is available since Micronaut Framework 4.0.

The implementation based on https://openjdk.org/groups/net/httpclient/intro.html[Java HTTP Client] does not support the following features:

* <<proxyClient,Proxy request>> support (we do support <<proxy,HTTP Proxies>>).
* Client Filters.
* Streaming support.
* Multipart requests.
* H2C and HTTP/3.

If you require any of these, we recommend you use the <<nettyHttpClient, implementation of the HTTP Client based on Netty>>.
