By default, Micronaut's HTTP client is configured to support HTTP 1.1. To enable support for HTTP/2, set the supported HTTP version in configuration:

.Enabling HTTP/2 in Clients
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    client:
      http-version: 2.0
----

Or by specifying the HTTP version to use when injecting the client:

.Injecting a HTTP/2 Client
[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Client(httpVersion=HttpVersion.HTTP_2_0)
ReactorHttpClient client;
----
