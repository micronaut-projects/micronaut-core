Micronaut's HTTP client includes support for streaming data over HTTP via the api:http.client.RxStreamingHttpClient[] interface which includes methods specific to streaming including:

.HTTP Streaming Methods
|===
|Method |Description

| `dataStream(HttpRequest<I> request)`
| Returns a stream of data as a rx:Flowable[] of api:core.io.buffer.ByteBuffer[]

| `exchangeStream(HttpRequest<I> request)`
| Returns the api:http.HttpResponse[] wrapping a rx:Flowable[] of api:core.io.buffer.ByteBuffer[]

| `jsonStream(HttpRequest<I> request)`
| Returns a non-blocking stream of JSON objects

|===

To use JSON streaming, declare a controller method on the server that returns a `application/x-json-stream` of JSON objects. For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.streaming.HeadlineController[tags="imports, streaming", indent=0, title="Streaming JSON on the Server"]

<1> The `streamHeadlines` method produces `application/x-json-stream`
<2> A rx:Flowable[] is created from a `Callable` function (note no blocking occurs within the function, so this is ok, otherwise you should `subscribeOn` an I/O thread pool).
<3> The rx:Flowable[] repeats 100 times
<4> The rx:Flowable[] emits items with a delay of one second between each

NOTE: The server does not have to be written in Micronaut, any server that supports JSON streaming will do.

Then on the client, subscribe to the stream using `jsonStream` and every time the server emits a JSON object the client will decode and consume it:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.streaming.HeadlineControllerSpec[tags="streaming", indent=0, title="Streaming JSON on the Client"]

<1> The `jsonStream` method returns a rx:Flowable[]
<2> A `CompletableFuture` is used to receive a value, but what you do with each emitted item is application-specific
<3> The rs:Subscription[] requests a single item. You can use the rs:Subscription[] to regulate back pressure and demand.
<4> The `onNext` method is called when an item is emitted
<5> The `onError` method is called when an error occurs
<6> The `onComplete` method is called when all `Headline` instances have been emitted

Note neither the server nor the client in the example above perform any blocking I/O.
