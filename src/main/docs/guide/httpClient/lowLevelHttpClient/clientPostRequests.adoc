All the examples so far have used the same HTTP method i.e `GET`. The api:http.HttpRequest[] interface has factory methods for all the different HTTP methods. The following table summarizes them:

.HttpRequest Factory Methods
|===
|Method |Description|Allows Body

| api:http.HttpRequest.GET(java.lang.String)[]
| Constructs an HTTP `GET` request
| `false`

| api:http.HttpRequest.OPTIONS(java.lang.String)[]
| Constructs an HTTP `OPTIONS` request
| `false`

| api:http.HttpRequest.HEAD(java.lang.String)[]
| Constructs an HTTP `HEAD` request
| `false`

| api:http.HttpRequest.POST(java.lang.String,T)[]
| Constructs an HTTP `POST` request
| `true`

| api:http.HttpRequest.PUT(java.lang.String,T)[]
| Constructs an HTTP `PUT` request
| `true`

| api:http.HttpRequest.PATCH(java.lang.String,T)[]
| Constructs an HTTP `PATCH` request
| `true`

| api:http.HttpRequest.DELETE(java.lang.String)[]
| Constructs an HTTP `DELETE` request
| `true`

|===

A `create` method also exists to construct a request for any api:http.HttpMethod[] type. Since the `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` methods require a body, a second argument which is the body object is required.

The following example demonstrates how to send a simple `String` body:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloControllerSpec[tags="poststring", indent=0, title="Sending a `String` body"]

<1> The `POST` method is used; the first argument is the URI and the second is the body
<2> The content type and accepted type are set to `text/plain` (the default is `application/json`)
<3> The expected response type is a `String`

== Sending JSON

The previous example sends plain text. To send JSON, pass the object to encode to JSON (whether that be a Map or a POJO) as long as Jackson is able to encode it.

For example, you can create a `Message` from the previous section and pass it to the `POST` method:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloControllerSpec[tags="postpojo", indent=0, title="Sending a JSON body"]

<1> An instance of `Message` is created and passed to the `POST` method
<2> The same class decodes the response

With the above example the following JSON is sent as the body of the request:

.Resulting JSON
[source,json]
----
{"text":"Hello John"}
----

The JSON can be customized using https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations[Jackson Annotations].

== Using a URI Template

If include some properties of the object in the URI, you can use a URI template.

For example imagine you have a `Book` class with a `title` property. You can include the `title` in the URI template and then populate it from an instance of `Book`. For example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.BookControllerSpec[tags="posturitemplate", indent=0, title="Sending a JSON body with a URI template"]

In the above case the `title` property is included in the URI.

== Sending Form Data

You can also encode a POJO or a map as form data instead of JSON. Just set the content type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` on the post request:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.BookControllerSpec[tags="postform", indent=0, title="Sending a Form Data"]

Note that Jackson can bind form data too, so to customize the binding process use https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations[Jackson annotations].
