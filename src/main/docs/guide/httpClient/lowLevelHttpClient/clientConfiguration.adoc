=== Global Configuration for All Clients

The default HTTP client configuration is a <<configurationProperties, Configuration Properties>> called api:http.client.DefaultHttpClientConfiguration[] that allows configuring the default behaviour for all HTTP clients. For example, in `application.yml`:

.Altering default HTTP client configuration
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    client:
      read-timeout: 5s
----

The above example sets of `readTimeout` property of the api:http.client.HttpClientConfiguration[] class.

=== Client Specific Configuration

If you wish to have a separate configuration per client then there a couple of options. You can configure <<serviceDiscoveryManual, Service Discovery>> manually in `application.yml` and apply per-client configuration:

.Manually configuring HTTP services
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    services:
      foo:
        urls:
          - http://foo1
          - http://foo2
        read-timeout: 5s # <1>
----

<1> The read timeout is applied to the `foo` client.

WARN: This client configuration can be used in conjunction with the `@Client` annotation, either by injecting an `HttpClient` directly or use on a client interface. In any case, all other attributes on the annotation *will be ignored* other than the service id.

Then simply inject the named client configuration:

.Injecting an HTTP client
[source,java]
----
@Client("foo") @Inject RxHttpClient httpClient;
----

You can also simply define a bean that extends from api:http.client.HttpClientConfiguration[] and ensuring that the `javax.inject.Named` annotation is used to name it appropriately:

.Defining an HTTP client configuration bean
[source,java]
----
@Named("twitter")
@Singleton
class TwitterHttpClientConfiguration extends HttpClientConfiguration {
   public TwitterHttpClientConfiguration(ApplicationConfiguration configuration) {
        super(configuration);
    }
}
----

This configuration will then be picked up if you inject a service called `twitter` using `@Client` using <<serviceDiscovery, Service Discovery>>:

.Injecting an HTTP client
[source,java]
----
@Client("twitter") @Inject RxHttpClient httpClient;
----

Alternatively if you are not using service discovery then you can use the `configuration` member of `@Client` to refer to a specific type:

.Injecting an HTTP client
[source,java]
----
@Client(value = "https://api.twitter.com/1.1",
        configuration = TwitterHttpClientConfiguration.class)
@Inject
RxHttpClient httpClient;
----

=== Using HTTP Client Connection Pooling

If you have a client that needs to handle a significant number of requests then you can benefit from enabling HTTP client connection pooling. The following configuration will enable pooling for the `foo` client:

.Manually configuring HTTP services
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    services:
      foo:
        urls:
          - http://foo1
          - http://foo2
        pool:
          enabled: true # <1>
          max-connections: 50 # <2>
----

<1> Enables the pool
<2> Sets the maximum number of connections in the pool

See the API for link:{api}/io/micronaut/http/client/HttpClientConfiguration.ConnectionPoolConfiguration.html[ConnectionPoolConfiguration] for details on available options to configure the pool.

=== Configuring Event Loop Groups

By default Micronaut will share a common Netty `EventLoopGroup` for worker threads and all HTTP clients threads.

This common `EventLoopGroup` can be configured via the `micronaut.netty.event-loops.default` property:

.Configuring The Default Event Loop
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  netty:
    event-loops:
      default:
        num-threads: 10
        prefer-native-transport: true
----

You can also use the `micronaut.netty.event-loops` setting to configure one or more additional event loops. The following table summarizes the properties:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.http.netty.channel.DefaultEventLoopGroupConfiguration.adoc[]

For example, if your interactions with an HTTP client involve CPU intensive work it may be worthwhile configuring a separate `EventLoopGroup` for one or all clients.

The following example configures an additional event loop group called "other" that uses 10 threads:

.Configuring Additional Event Loops
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  netty:
    event-loops:
      other:
        num-threads: 10
        prefer-native-transport: true
----

Once an additional event loop has been configured you can alter the HTTP client configuration to use the newly defined event loop group:

.Altering the Event Loop Group used by Clients
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    client:
      event-loop-group: other
----
