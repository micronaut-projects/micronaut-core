=== Global Configuration for All Clients

The default HTTP client configuration is a <<configurationProperties, Configuration Properties>> named api:http.client.DefaultHttpClientConfiguration[] that allows configuring the default behaviour for all HTTP clients. For example, in your configuration file (e.g `application.yml`):

.Altering default HTTP client configuration
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    client:
      read-timeout: 5s
----

The above example sets the `readTimeout` property of the api:http.client.HttpClientConfiguration[] class.

=== Client Specific Configuration

To have separate configuration per-client, there are a couple of options. You can configure <<serviceDiscoveryManual, Service Discovery>> manually in your configuration file (e.g `application.yml`) and apply per-client configuration:

.Manually configuring HTTP services
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    services:
      foo:
        urls:
          - http://foo1
          - http://foo2
        read-timeout: 5s
----

- The `read-timeout` is applied to the `foo` client.

WARN: This client configuration can be used in conjunction with the `@Client` annotation, either by injecting an `HttpClient` directly or use on a client interface. In any case, all other attributes on the annotation *will be ignored* except the service id.

Then, inject the named client configuration:

.Injecting an HTTP client
[source,java]
----
@Client("foo") @Inject ReactorHttpClient httpClient;
----

You can also define a bean that extends from api:http.client.HttpClientConfiguration[] and ensure that the `jakarta.inject.Named` annotation names it appropriately:

.Defining an HTTP client configuration bean
[source,java]
----
@Named("twitter")
@Singleton
class TwitterHttpClientConfiguration extends HttpClientConfiguration {
   public TwitterHttpClientConfiguration(ApplicationConfiguration configuration) {
        super(configuration);
    }
}
----

This configuration will be picked up if you inject a service named `twitter` with `@Client` using <<serviceDiscovery, Service Discovery>>:

.Injecting an HTTP client
[source,java]
----
@Client("twitter") @Inject ReactorHttpClient httpClient;
----

Alternatively, if you don't use service discovery you can use the `configuration` member of `@Client` to refer to a specific type:

.Injecting an HTTP client
[source,java]
----
@Client(value = "https://api.twitter.com/1.1",
        configuration = TwitterHttpClientConfiguration.class)
@Inject
ReactorHttpClient httpClient;
----

=== Connection Pooling and HTTP/2

Connections using normal HTTP (without TLS/SSL) use HTTP/1.1. This can be configured using the `plaintext-mode` configuration option.

Secure connections (i.e. HTTP**S**, with TLS/SSL) use a feature called "Application Layer Protocol Negotiation" (ALPN) that is part of TLS to select the HTTP version. If the server supports HTTP/2, the Micronaut HTTP Client will use that capability by default, but if it doesn't, HTTP/1.1 is still supported. This is configured using the `alpn-modes` option, which is a list of supported ALPN protocol IDs (`"h2"` and `"http/1.1"`).

NOTE: The HTTP/2 standard forbids the use of certain less secure TLS cipher suites for HTTP/2 connections. When the HTTP client supports HTTP/2 (which is the default), it will not support those cipher suites. Removing `"h2"` from `alpn-modes` will enable support for all cipher suites.

Each HTTP/1.1 connection can only support one request at a time, but can be reused for subsequent requests using the `keep-alive` mechanism. HTTP/2 connections can support any number of concurrent requests.

To remove the overhead of opening a new connection for each request, the Micronaut HTTP Client will reuse HTTP connections wherever possible. They are managed in a _connection pool_. HTTP/1.1 connections are kept around using keep-alive and are used for new requests, and for HTTP/2, a single connection is used for all requests.

.Manually configuring HTTP services
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    services:
      foo:
        urls:
          - http://foo1
          - http://foo2
        pool:
          max-concurrent-http1-connections: 50
          enabled: true
          max-connections: 50
----
- Limit maximum concurrent HTTP/1.1 connections
- `max-concurrent-http1-connections` limits the maximum concurrent HTTP/1.1 connections to 50.
- `pool` enables the pool and sets the maximum number of connections for it

See the API for link:{api}/io/micronaut/http/client/HttpClientConfiguration.ConnectionPoolConfiguration.html[ConnectionPoolConfiguration] for details on available pool configuration options.

By setting the `pool.enabled` property to `false`, you can disable connection reuse. The pool is still used and other configuration options (e.g. concurrent HTTP 1 connections) still apply, but one connection will only serve one request.

=== Configuring Event Loop Groups

By default, the Micronaut framework shares a common Netty `EventLoopGroup` for worker threads and all HTTP client threads.

This `EventLoopGroup` can be configured via the `micronaut.netty.event-loops.default` property:

.Configuring The Default Event Loop
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  netty:
    event-loops:
      default:
        num-threads: 10
        prefer-native-transport: true
----

You can also use the `micronaut.netty.event-loops` setting to configure one or more additional event loops. The following table summarizes the properties:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.http.netty.channel.DefaultEventLoopGroupConfiguration.adoc[]

For example, if your interactions with an HTTP client involve CPU-intensive work, it may be worthwhile configuring a separate `EventLoopGroup` for one or all clients.

The following example configures an additional event loop group called "other" with 10 threads:

.Configuring Additional Event Loops
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  netty:
    event-loops:
      other:
        num-threads: 10
        prefer-native-transport: true
----

Once an additional event loop has been configured you can alter the HTTP client configuration to use it:

.Altering the Event Loop Group used by Clients
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  http:
    client:
      event-loop-group: other
----
