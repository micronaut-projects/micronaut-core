==== Obtaining a HttpClient

There are a few ways by which you can obtain a reference to a api:http.client.HttpClient[]. The most common way is using the api:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation. For example:

.Injecting an HTTP client
[source,java]
----
@Client("https://api.twitter.com/1.1") @Inject RxHttpClient httpClient;
----

The above example will inject a client that targets the Twitter API.

[source,kotlin]
----
@field:Client("\${myapp.api.twitter.url}") @Inject lateinit var httpClient: RxHttpClient
----

The above Kotlin example will inject a client that targets the Twitter API using a configuration path. Note the required escaping (backslash) on `"\${path.to.config}"` which is required due to Kotlin string interpolation.

The api:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation is also a custom scope that will manage the creation of api:http.client.HttpClient[] instances and ensure they are shutdown when the application shuts down.

The value you pass to the api:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation can be one of the following:

* A absolute URI. Example `https://api.twitter.com/1.1`
* A relative URI, in which case the server targeted will be the current server (useful for testing)
* A service identifier. See the section on <<serviceDiscovery, Service Discovery>> for more information on this topic.

Another way to create an `HttpClient` is with the `create` static method of the api:http.client.RxHttpClient[], however this approach is not recommended as you will have to ensure you manually shutdown the client and of course no dependency injection will occur for the created client.

==== Performing an HTTP GET

Generally there are two methods of interest when working with the `HttpClient`. The first method is called `retrieve`, which will execute an HTTP request and return the body in whichever type you request (by default a `String`) as an RxJava rx:Flowable[].

The `retrieve` method accepts an api:http.HttpRequest[] object or a `String` URI to the endpoint you wish to request.

The following example shows how to use `retrieve` to execute an HTTP `GET` and receive the response body as a `String`:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloControllerSpec[tags="simple", indent=0, title="Using retrieve"]

Note that in this example, for illustration purposes we are calling `toBlocking()` to return a blocking version of the client. However, in production code you should not do this and instead rely on the non-blocking nature of the Micronaut HTTP server.

For example the following `@Controller` method calls another endpoint in a non-blocking manner:


snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloController[tags="imports, nonblocking", indent=0, title="Using the HTTP client without blocking"]

<1> The method `hello` returns a rx:Maybe[] which may or may not emit an item. If an item is not emitted a 404 is returned.
<2> The `retrieve` method is called which returns a rx:Flowable[] which has a `firstElement` method that returns the first emitted item or nothing

TIP: Using RxJava (or Reactor if you prefer) you can easily and efficiently compose multiple HTTP client calls without blocking (which will limit the throughput and scalability of your application).

==== Debugging / Tracing the HTTP Client

To debug the requests being sent and received from the HTTP client you can enable tracing logging via your `logback.xml` file:

.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<logger name="io.micronaut.http.client" level="TRACE"/>
----

==== Client Specific Debugging / Tracing

To enable client-specific logging you could configure the default logger for all HTTP clients. And, you could also configure different loggers for different clients using <<_client_specific_configuration, Client Specific Configuration>>. For example, in `application.yml`:

.application.yml
[source,xml]
----
micronaut:
    http:
        client:
            logger-name: mylogger
        services:
            otherClient:
                logger-name: other.client
----

And, then enable logging in `logback.yml`:

.logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<logger name="mylogger" level="DEBUG"/>
<logger name="other.client" level="TRACE"/>
----

==== Customizing the HTTP Request

The previous example demonstrated using the static methods of the api:http.HttpRequest[] interface to construct a api:http.MutableHttpRequest[] instance. Like the name suggests a `MutableHttpRequest` can be mutated including the ability to add headers, customize the request body and so on. For example:


snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloControllerSpec[tags="headers", indent=0, title="Passing an HttpRequest to retrieve"]

The above example adds an additional header called `X-My-Header` to the request before it is sent. The api:http.MutableHttpRequest[] interface has a bunch more convenience methods that make it easy to modify the request in common ways.


==== Reading JSON Responses

Typically with Microservices a message encoding format is used such as JSON. Micronaut's HTTP client leverages Jackson for JSON parsing hence whatever type Jackson can decode can passed as a second argument to `retrieve`.

For example consider the following `@Controller` method that returns a JSON response:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloController[tags="json", indent=0, title="Returning JSON from a controller"]

The method above returns a POJO of type `Message` which looks like:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.Message[tags="imports, class", indent=0, title="Message POJO"]

NOTE: Jackson annotations are used to map the constructor

On the client end you can call this endpoint and decode the JSON into a map using the `retrieve` method as follows:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloControllerSpec[tags="jsonmap", indent=0, title="Decoding the response body to a Map"]

The above examples decodes the response into a jdk:java.util.Map[], representing the JSON. If you wish to customize the type of the key and string you can use the `Argument.of(..)` method:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloControllerSpec[tags="jsonmaptypes", indent=0, title="Decoding the response body to a Map"]

<1> The `Argument.of` method is used to return a `Map` whether the key and value are typed as `String`


Whilst retrieving JSON as a map can be desirable, more often than not you will want to decode objects into Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). To do that simply pass the type instead:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloControllerSpec[tags="jsonpojo", indent=0, title="Decoding the response body to a POJO"]

Note how you can use the same Java type on both the client and the server. The implication of this is that typically you will want to define a common API project where you define the interfaces and types that define your API.

==== Decoding Other Content Types

If the server you are communicating with uses a custom content type that is not JSON by default Micronaut's HTTP client will not know how to decode this type.

To resolve this issue you can register api:http.codec.MediaTypeCodec[] as a bean and it will be automatically picked up and used to decode (or encode) messages.

==== Receiving the Full HTTP Response

Sometimes, receiving just the object is not enough and you need information about the response. In this case, instead of `retrieve` you should use the `exchange` method:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.basics.HelloControllerSpec[tags="pojoresponse", indent=0, title="Receiving the Full HTTP Response"]

<1> The `exchange` method is used to receive the api:http.HttpResponse[]
<2> The body can be retrieved using the `getBody(..)` method of the response
<3> Other aspects of the response, such as the api:http.HttpStatus[] can be checked

The above example receives the full api:http.HttpResponse[] object from which you can obtain headers and other useful information.
