Since the Micronaut framework 4.x, Micronaut's Netty-based HTTP client can be configured to support HTTP/3. This support is experimental and may change without notice.

Instead of the TCP used for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, HTTP/3 runs on UDP. If the client is configured with the special `h3` value for the `alpn-modes` property, the client will automatically use HTTP/3 over UDP instead of HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 over TCP. At this time, the client cannot fall back to TCP if the server does not support HTTP/3.

Additionally, the netty HTTP/3 codec needs to be present on the classpath:

dependency:netty-incubator-codec-http3[groupId="io.netty.incubator",artifactId="netty-incubator-codec-http3"]
