A common requirement in Microservice environments is to proxy requests in a Gateway Microservice to other backend Microservices.

The regular api:http.client.HttpClient[] API is designed around simplifying message exchange and is not designed for proxying requests. For this case, use the api:http.client.ProxyHttpClient[], which can be used from a <<filters, HTTP Server Filter>> to proxy requests to backend Microservices.

The following example demonstrates rewriting requests under the URI `/proxy` to the URI `/real` onto the same server (although in a real environment you generally proxy to another server):

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.http.client.proxy.ProxyFilter[tags="imports,class", indent=0, title="Customizing the Netty pipeline for Logbook"]

<1> The filter extends api:http.filter.HttpServerFilter[]
<2> The api:http.client.ProxyHttpClient[] is injected into the constructor.
<3> The `proxy` method proxies the request
<4> The request is mutated to modify the URI and include an additional header
<5> The api:http.uri.UriBuilder[] API rewrites the URI
<6> Additional request and response headers are included

NOTE: The api:http.client.ProxyHttpClient[] API is a low-level API that can be used to build a higher-level abstraction such as an API Gateway.
