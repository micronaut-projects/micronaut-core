The api:http.client.HttpClient[] interface forms the basis for the low-level API. This interfaces declares methods to help ease executing HTTP requests and receiving responses.

The majority of the methods in the api:http.client.HttpClient[] interface return Reactive Streams rs:Publisher[] instances, which is not always the most useful interface to work against. A sub-interface named api:http.client.ReactorHttpClient[] is included that provides a variation of the api:http.client.HttpClient[] interface that returns RxJava reactor:Flux[] types.
