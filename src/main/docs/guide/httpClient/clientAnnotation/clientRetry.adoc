Being able to recover from failure is critical for HTTP clients, and that is where the integrated <<retry, Retry Advice>> included as part of Micronaut comes in really handy.

You can declare the ann:retry.annotation.Retryable[] or ann:retry.annotation.CircuitBreaker[] annotations on any ann:http.client.Client[] interface and the retry policy will be applied, for example:

.Declaring @Retryable
[source,java]
----
include::{testsclient}/annotation/retry/PetClient.java[tags=class, indent=0]
