Being able to recover from failure is critical for HTTP clients, and that is where the integrated <<retry, Retry Advice>> included as part of Micronaut comes in really handy.

You can declare the ann:retry.annotation.Retryable[] or ann:retry.annotation.CircuitBreaker[] annotations on any ann:http.client.annotation.Client[] interface and the retry policy will be applied, for example:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.annotation.retry.PetClient[tags="class", indent=0, title="Declaring @Retryable"]


For more information on customizing retry, see the section on <<retry, Retry Advice>>.
