In distributed systems, failure happens and it is best to be prepared for it and handle it gracefully.

In addition, when developing Microservices it is quite common to work on a single Microservice without other Microservices the project requires being available.

With that in mind, Micronaut features a native fallback mechanism that is integrated into <<retry, Retry Advice>> that allows falling back to another implementation in the case of failure.

Using the ann:retry.annotation.Fallback[] annotation, you can declare a fallback implementation of a client to be used when all possible retries have been exhausted.

In fact the mechanism is not strictly linked to Retry; you can declare any class as ann:retry.annotation.Recoverable[], and if a method call fails (or, in the case of reactive types, an error is emitted) a class annotated with `@Fallback` will be searched for.

To illustrate this, consider again the `PetOperations` interface declared earlier. You can define a `PetFallback` class that will be called in the case of failure:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.annotation.retry.PetFallback[tags="class", indent=0, title="Defining a Fallback"]

TIP: If you only need fallbacks to help with testing against external Microservices, you can define fallbacks in the `src/test/java` directory so they are not included in production code.

As you can see the fallback does not perform any network operations and is quite simple, hence will provide a successful result in the case of an external system being down.

Of course, the actual behaviour of the fallback is up to you. You can for example implement a fallback that pulls data from a local cache when real data is not available, and sends alert emails or other notifications to operations about downtime.
