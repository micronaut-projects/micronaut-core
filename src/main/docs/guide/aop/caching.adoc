Like Spring and Grails, Micronaut provides caching annotations in the link:{micronautcacheapi}/package-summary.html[io.micronaut.cache] package.

The link:{micronautcacheapi}/CacheManager.html[CacheManager] interface allows different cache implementations to be plugged in as necessary.

The link:{micronautcacheapi}/SyncCache.html[SyncCache] interface provides a synchronous API for caching, whilst the link:{micronautcacheapi}/AsyncCache.html[AsyncCache] API allows non-blocking operation.

== Cache Annotations

The following cache annotations are supported:

- link:{micronautcacheapi}/annotation/Cacheable.html[@Cacheable] - Indicates a method is cacheable in the specified cache
- link:{micronautcacheapi}/annotation/CachePut.html[@CachePut] - Indicates that the return value of a method invocation should be cached. Unlike `@Cacheable` the original operation is never skipped.
- link:{micronautcacheapi}/annotation/CacheInvalidate.html[@CacheInvalidate] - Indicates the invocation of a method should cause the invalidation of one or more caches.

Using one of these annotations activates the api:cache.interceptor.CacheInterceptor[], which in the case of `@Cacheable` caches the return value of the method.

The emitted result is cached if the method return type is a non-blocking type (either link:{jdkapi}/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture] or an instance of rs:Publisher[]) .

In addition, if the underlying Cache implementation supports non-blocking cache operations, cache values are read without blocking, resulting in non-blocking cache operations.

== Configuring Caches

By default, https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[Caffeine] is used to create caches from application configuration. For example with `application.yml`:

.Cache Configuration Example
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
  caches:
    my-cache:
      maximum-size: 20
----

The above example configures a cache called "my-cache" with a maximum size of 20.

[NOTE]
.Naming Caches
====
Define names of caches under `micronaut.caches` in kebab case (lowercase and hyphen separated); if you use camel case, the names are normalized to kebab case. For example `myCache` becomes `my-cache`. The kebab-case form must be used when referencing caches in the {micronautcacheapi}/annotation/Cacheable.html[@Cacheable] annotation.
====

To configure a weigher to be used with the `maximumWeight` configuration, create a bean that implements `io.micronaut.caffeine.cache.Weigher`. To associate a given weigher with only a specific cache, annotate the bean with `@Named(<cache name>)`. Weighers without a named qualifier apply to all caches that don't have a named weigher. If no beans are found, a default implementation is used.

See the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-cache/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.cache.caffeine.DefaultCacheConfiguration[configuration reference] for all available configuration options.

== Dynamic Cache Creation

A {micronautcacheapi}/DynamicCacheManager.html[DynamicCacheManager] bean can be registered for use cases where caches cannot be configured ahead of time. When a cache is attempted to be retrieved that was not predefined, the dynamic cache manager is invoked to create and return a cache.

By default, if there is no other dynamic cache manager defined in the application, Micronaut registers an instance of {micronautcacheapi}/caffeine/DefaultDynamicCacheManager.html[DefaultDynamicCacheManager] that creates Caffeine caches with default values.

== Other Cache Implementations
