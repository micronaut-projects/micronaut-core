Validation advice is one of the most common advice types you are likely to want to incorporate into your application.

Validation advice is built on https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/[Bean Validation JSR 380].

JSR 380 is a specification of the Java API for bean validation which ensures that the
properties of a bean meet specific criteria, using `javax.validation` annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Min`, and `@Max`.

Micronaut provides native support for the `javax.validation` annotations with the `micronaut-validation` dependency:

dependency::micronaut-validation[]

Or full JSR 380 compliance with the `micronaut-hibernate-validator` dependency:

dependency::micronaut-hibernate-validator[]

See the section on <<beanValidation, Bean Validation>> for more informatino on how to apply validation rules to your bean classes.
