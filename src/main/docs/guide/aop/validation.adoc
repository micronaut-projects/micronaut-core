Validation advice is one of the most common advice types you are likely to want to use in your application.

Validation advice is built on https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/[Bean Validation JSR 380], a specification of the Java API for bean validation which ensures that the properties of a bean meet specific criteria, using `jakarta.validation` annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Min`, and `@Max`.

The Micronaut framework provides native support for the `jakarta.validation` annotations with the `micronaut-validation` dependency:

dependency:micronaut-validation-processor[groupId="io.micronaut.validation",scope="annotationProcessor"]

dependency:micronaut-validation[groupId="io.micronaut.validation"]

Or full https://beanvalidation.org/2.0/spec/[JSR 380] compliance with the `micronaut-hibernate-validator` dependency:

dependency::micronaut-hibernate-validator[groupId="io.micronaut.beanvalidation"]

See the section on <<beanValidation, Bean Validation>> for more information on how to apply validation rules to your bean classes.
