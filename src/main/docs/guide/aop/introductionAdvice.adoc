Introduction advice is distinct from Around advice in that it involves providing an implementation instead of decorating.

Examples of introduction advice include things like http://gorm.grails.org[GORM] or http://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] that will both automatically implement persistence logic for you.

Micronaut's api:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation is another example of introduction advice where Micronaut will, at compile time, implement HTTP client interfaces for you.

The way you implement Introduction advice is very similar to how you implement Around advice.

You start off by defining an annotation that will power the introduction advice. As an example, say you want to implement advice that will return a stubbed value for every method in an interface (a common requirement in testing frameworks). Consider the following `@Stub` annotation:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.aop.introduction.Stub[tags="imports,class", indent=0, title="Introduction Advice Annotation Example"]

<1> The introduction advice is annotated with api:aop.Introduction[]
<2> The api:context.annotation.Type[] annotation is used to refer to the implementor of the advice. In this case `StubIntroduction`
<3> The api:context.annotation.Bean[] annotation is added so that all types annotated with `@Stub` become beans

The `StubIntroduction` class referred to in the previous example must then implement the api:aop.MethodInterceptor[] interface, just like around advice.

The following is an example implementation:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.aop.introduction.StubIntroduction[tags="imports,class", indent=0, title="StubIntroduction"]

<1> The class is annotated with `@Singleton` and implements the api:aop.MethodInterceptor[] interface
<2> The value of the `@Stub` annotation is read from the context and an attempt made to convert the value to the return type
<3> Otherwise `null` is returned

To now use this introduction advice in an application you simply annotate your abstract classes or interfaces with `@Stub`:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.aop.introduction.StubExample[tags="class", indent=0, title="StubExample"]

All abstract methods will delegate to the `StubIntroduction` class to be implemented.

The following test demonstrates the behaviour or `StubIntroduction`:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.aop.introduction.IntroductionSpec[tags="test", indent=0, title="Testing Introduction Advice"]

Note that if the introduction advice cannot implement the method the `proceed` method of the api:aop.MethodInvocationContext[] should be called. This gives the opportunity for other introduction advice interceptors to implement the method, otherwise a `UnsupportedOperationException` will be thrown if no advice can implement the method.

In addition, if multiple introduction advice are present you may wish to override the `getOrder()` method of api:aop.MethodInterceptor[] to control the priority of advise.

The following sections cover core advice types that are built into Micronaut and provided by the framework.
