https://www.rabbitmq.com[RabbitMQ] is the most widely deployed open source message broker.

The Micronaut framework features dedicated support for defining both RabbitMQ publishers and consumers. Micronaut's applications built with RabbitMQ can be deployed with or without an HTTP server.

With Micronaut framework's efficient compile-time AOP, using RabbitMQ has never been easier. Support has been added for publisher confirms and RPC through reactive streams.

See the documentation for https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-rabbitmq/latest/guide[Micronaut RabbitMQ] for more information on how to build RabbitMQ applications with Micronaut.
