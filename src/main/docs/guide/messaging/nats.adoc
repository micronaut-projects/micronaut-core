https://nats.io/[Nats.io] is a simple, secure and high performance open source messaging system for cloud native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures.

Micronaut features dedicated support for defining both Nats.io publishers and consumers. Micronaut applications built with Nats.io can be deployed with or without the presence of an HTTP server.

With Micronaut's efficient compile-time AOP, using Nats.io has never been easier. Support has been added for publisher confirms and RPC through reactive streams.

See the documentation for https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-nats/latest/guide/[Micronaut Nats] for more information on how to build Nats.io applications with Micronaut.
