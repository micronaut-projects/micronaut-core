Reloading (or "hot-loading") refers to the framework reinitializing classes (and parts of the application) when changes to the source files are detected.

Since Micronaut prioritizes startup time and most Micronaut apps can start up within seconds, a productive workflow can often be had by restarting the application as changes are made; for example, by running a test class within an IDE.

However, if you wish to have your changes automatically reloaded Micronaut does support automatic restart or the use of third-party reloading agents.
