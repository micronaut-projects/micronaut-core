Gradle supports https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:continuous_build[continuous builds], letting you run a task that will be rerun whenever source files change. To use this with a reloading agent (configured as described above), run the application normally (with the agent), and then run a recompilation task in a separate terminal with continuous mode enabled.

.Run the app
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew run
----

.Run the recompilation
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew -t classes
----

The `classes` task will be rerun every time a source file is modified, allowing the reloading agent to pick up the change.
