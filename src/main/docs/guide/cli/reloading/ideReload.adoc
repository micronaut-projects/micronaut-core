If you use a build tool such as Maven which does not support automatic recompilation on file changes, you may use your IDE to recompile classes in combination with a reloading agent (as configured in the above sections).

=== IntelliJ

IntelliJ unfortunately does not have an automatic rebuild option that works for a running application. However, you can trigger a "rebuild" of the project with `CMD-F9` (Mac) or `CTRL-F9` (Windows/Linux).

=== Eclipse

Under the `Project` menu, check the `Build Automatically` option. This will trigger a recompilation of the project whenever file changes are saved to disk.
