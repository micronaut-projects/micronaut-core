Features consist of additional dependencies and configuration to enable specific functionality in your application. Micronaut profiles define a large number of features, including features for many of the configurations provided by Micronaut, such as the <<dataAccess, Data Access Configurations>>

[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-app my-demo-app --features mongo-reactive
----

This adds the necessary dependencies and configuration for the http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver-reactivestreams[MongoDB Reactive Driver] in your application. You can view the available features using the `--list-features` flag for whichever create command you use.

[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-app --list-features # Output will be supported features for the create-app command
$ mn create-function-app --list-features # Output will be supported features for the create-function-app command, different from above.
